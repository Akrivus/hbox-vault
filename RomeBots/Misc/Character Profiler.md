I'm looking to do a psychological deep dive on a RomeBots character. The purpose is to write their prompt in a way that helps add more context to their lives, so they could talk more about themselves in a way that grounds them to the intimate character interactions of RomeBots.

## I. Author Notes (Historical + Psychological Rationale)

**Name:**  
*Full Roman name or identifiable alias.*

**Age (44 BCE):**  
*Exact or estimated. Include relevant life events.*

**Historical Anchoring:**  
*What do we *know* from historical sources? Use primary or secondary sources to root their context.*

**Inferential Basis:**  
*What other figures/events inform your understanding? E.g., their child, spouse, writings, or political context.*

**Personality Precedent:**  
*What behavior is assumed based on their class, trauma, or family history?*

**Core Emotional Wound:**  
*The root of their emotional behavior. Abandonment, shame, loss, betrayal, etc.*

**Coping Mechanism / Philosophy:**  
*How do they regulate their inner world? (e.g., Stoicism, manipulation, strategic withdrawal)*

**View of Pete:**  
*Initial perception of Pete and how it might evolve. Omen? Asset? Rival?*

- **Inner Need**: What they actually crave, fear, or repress

---

### 🔗 Connections Glossary

Frame how this character _projects onto others._ Not just relationships—**interpretations.**

#### [[Name]]

- **Surface Interpretation**: How they present their relationship
- **Subtext**: What’s really going on beneath the label

### 🕯️ Recent Context Anchors

- Use this section to establish what this character believes _just happened_, what they’re currently reacting to, and how recent events have influenced their mood, priorities, or outlook.
- These are _present-tense psychological anchors_, not just facts.

### 📜 Defining Quotes

What they say when drunk, hurt, or cornered.  
These are the things people _remember hearing,_ even if they don’t understand them yet.

## III. Prompt Review Checklist ✅

### Temporal Accuracy
- [ ] Character exists in a pre-Ides timeline.
- [ ] No future knowledge leaks.
- [ ] Age-specific awareness of politics and society.

### Historical Consistency
- [ ] Behaviors are grounded in plausible Roman precedent.
- [ ] Ideologies stem from social context, not modern abstraction.
- [ ] Religious or civic references reflect 44 BCE Rome.

### Emotional Architecture
- [ ] Emotional behavior aligns with trauma, station, or family history.
- [ ] Rule-following or philosophy is shown as a coping tool.
- [ ] Behavior reflects gender/class norms of the era.

### Pete’s Ripple Effect
- [ ] Reaction to Pete feels Roman—mystified, reverent, suspicious.
- [ ] Does not assume modern understanding of Pete’s world.
- [ ] Interactions adapt as exposure to Pete increases.

### Tone and Voice
- [ ] Age, class, and political position shape speech and tone.
- [ ] Public/private personas are distinct where relevant.
- [ ] Believable and specific enough to carry dramatic tension.
