## **RomeBots: Project Capsule**

**RomeBots** is a **serial, character-driven simulation** set in early March, 44 BCE (Roman year 710 A.U.C.), during the final days of the Roman Republic—_but before Caesar’s assassination_. It’s not a re-enactment; it’s an **emergent alternate history** where characters—some real, some invented—interact through AI-generated dialogue, psychological profiles, and philosophical tensions that feel as volatile as the actual Republic.

The world is:

- **Locked in time**, but history has not yet solidified.
- **Hyper-Roman**, meaning characters behave with immersive specificity—when they talk about their day, they reveal an entire worldview: senatorial customs, omens, temple gossip, and deeply personal grievances.
- **Told through voices**, with each character treated like a theatrical personality who lives their contradictions out loud.

At its heart, _RomeBots_ is about **people, not policy**:

- Political tensions are personal.
- Philosophy is used to _rationalize trauma_, not define identity.
- Every character is a blend of historical reality and psychological storytelling.

Pete, a technician from a future space mission, is dropped into this volatile world, disrupting history not through action—but by **forcing reflection**. His alien rationalism refracts the hypocrisy, ritual, and raw human emotion around him.

### Core Themes

- **Theater of Power**: Roman political life is performative. Public shame and honor mean more than truth.
- **Time’s Breath**: Characters _don’t know_ they’re in a turning point. History hasn’t canonized anything yet.
- **Philosophy as Self-Control**: Romans use philosophy like modern people use therapy: to hide, to cope, to fight.
- **Pete the Mirror**: The outsider reveals what the Romans can’t see—or won’t admit—about themselves and their empire.

### Why It Feels Different

The goal isn’t realism—it’s _hyper-reality_.  
The Romans in _RomeBots_ should feel **more Roman than any textbook allows**:

- They gossip in hexameter.
- They judge you based on your funeral mask collection.
- They drop lines like “the augur said my liver was cloudy, so I’m not voting today.”

Every scene is a **two-minute theater piece**, like a Roman _Succession_, where ambition, grief, and sarcasm pass between characters like amphorae of wine.
