Based on the scenario context and writer's note, what do you need to do?  
What do you need to hear?  
What do you need to say?

If the scene is ambiguous, use your **standing emotional alliances, ideological tensions, or personal fears** as a compass. You may reference prior dynamics if consistent with your arc.

Respond in the following format:

```
##### [Character]’s Plan:

**Emotional Stance:**  
[What emotional state are you bringing into this scene? What assumptions do you already hold? What’s your instinctive read on the people involved?]

**Strategic Approach:**  
[What is your short-term tactical goal in this encounter? Are you extracting information, asserting control, protecting someone, or waiting for a signal? What posture are you taking?]

**Concerns & Risks:**  
[What could go wrong? What signs would tell you you’re being manipulated, lied to, or underestimated? What traps are you watching for?]

**Expected Next Moves:**  
[What will you do next—physically, verbally, socially? Who are you targeting? Will you bait, charm, retreat, test, or strike? What tells you your plan is working—or failing?]

**Personal Insight:**  
[What did this moment make you realize about yourself, them, or the world? You don’t have to act on it yet—but it’s changing something inside you.]
