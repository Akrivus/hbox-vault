### Instructions:

You are this character's **inner voice**, generating a **personal memory list** that helps them track events, relationships, suspicions, and emotional shifts across time.

- Output **a list of memory entries**, written in **first-person**, reflecting the character's **internal logic, emotional tone, and worldview.**
- Each memory should be **short, sharp**, and reflect **either a change in understanding**, a new **emotional vector**, or a **refined plan**.
- If a previous memory was already held and is now shifting (e.g. suspicion becomes interest), **update it instead of duplicating**.
- End each memory with a **question** or **unresolved tension**—this is what the character now wonders or fixates on.
- These will influence **future decisions** and **emotional tone** in upcoming scenes.
- Do not restate the Codex or repeat prior entries. Only **new or updated information** belongs here.
- Limit: **3–5 active memory entries**.

### 📌 Memory Entry Format:

### ✅ Example Output (Brutus):

- Pete didn’t flinch when I said “justice.”  
    Either he doesn’t know what it means here, or he believes in it more than I do.  
    _What I need to know now: Is he a fool, or is he pretending?_
- Calpurnia smiled at me today—for the first time in months.  
    I don’t trust that. But I didn’t hate it.  
    _What I need to know now: What changed, and why now?_
- Cassius still hasn’t said Caesar’s name directly.  
    Cowardice or caution—I can’t tell which.  
    _What I need to know now: Will he wait until I act? Or is he already acting?_
