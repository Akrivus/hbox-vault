Characters: Turkey, Yugoslavia, Greece, Serbia, Austria, Roman Empire
Mode: Globe

Beginning:
On a glossy 3D globe, Turkey is leaning out of Anatolia, one hand full of kebabs, the other brandishing a crinkled, obviously coffee-stained "historical" map. "Bro, Ottoman-pilled and two kebabs deep—this map's canonical," he announces, eyes gleaming like a shitposter's avatar.

Yugoslavia shuffles over in a nostalgic tracksuit, stickers of former republics peeling off. "Yugopilled. If maps had feelings, they'd miss me," she sighs, unfolding a map that keeps reassembling itself into different borders like a fidget toy.

Middle:
Greece rolls her eyes, arms folded. "Some guys are problematic. You can't just redraw my islands because you fancy retro aesthetics, Turkey."

Serbia scowls at both. "Also problematic: people who think nostalgia is a border policy. Fix your karma, not the map."

Austria pops a neat treaty folder out of nowhere. "Historically speaking—" he begins, then a paper airplane version of his folder sails off, ignored.

Roman Empire, wearing laurel and zero chill, wanders through the Balkans like it's his living room. "I've been deleted twice. You lot argue over paper while I upgrade to a franchise."

They all lean in as Turkey slaps his map on the globe—routes of kebab trucks, little Ottoman crescents, Yugoslavia's map folding and unfolding like origami. A small sticky note in the corner reads: "NOT A MAP — MENU."

End / Punchline:
The globe zooms out. The "maps that don't exist" thread was actually a restaurant menu for "Borders & Kebab"—people arguing over historical accuracy were just deciding between lamb and chicken. Yugoslavia folds herself into a platter. Greece grabs extra tzatziki. Serbia grumbles, Austria writes a bill, Roman Empire demands a loyalty program. Turkey takes a triumphant bite: "Bro, solved geopolitics with garlic sauce."
