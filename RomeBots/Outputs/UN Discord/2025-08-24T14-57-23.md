Beginning — Britain bursts into #security-council like an intern on triple espresso:
Britain (typing at 200 WPM): "ALRIGHT TEAM — hot take inspired by 'Putin can be stopped' speech. I have a 12-step, zero-ambiguity, ultra-lean theatrical playbook. Think tanks call it 'Plan: Actually Stop Him™.' Ready, General? Ready? I am READY."

Middle — rapid-fire "analyst" pitch, America plays grizzled general, others react:
America (voice): "Britain, slow down. Speak in bullets I can shoot at."
Britain: "Fine. Bullets. 1) Diplomatic squeeze — ceremonial embargoes (no state dinner invites!). 2) Economic choreography — synchronized tariff tango with surprise tariffs at 0200 GMT. 3) Cognitive warfare — deploy viral sympathy memes starring slippers. 4) Kinetic — not that kind, more like 'deploy moral clarity' via theatre tours across capitals. Target: morale, reputation, snack supply chains. Outcome: Putin realizes he can't steal our good table settings."
Ukraine (text, panicked): "This is adorable and terrifying. Which of these involve actual defense aid?"
Britain (caps again): "All of them! It's holistic. Also: free tea for frontline diplomats."
Russia (GIF + text): "A bear clapping. Very cute. We offer complimentary irony and suggest Britain try it with history lessons."
France (mods tag): "Britain, you are unmuted only because my croissant is in this. Also: if you mention 'theatre tours' you must credit France for cultural authenticity."
United Nations (weary admin): "Please keep it civil. No theatrical embargoes in voice channel. Britain — stop spamming all-caps or I will invoke slow-mode."
Britain (whisper DM to America): "Sir, imagine—a decisive counter-narrative campaign, sanctions, and a surprise joint photography op with ambassadors wearing matching sweaters. It will go viral. It'll be like soft power, but caffeinated."
America (dry): "I want *feasible* options with timelines and logistic cost. Also, stop with the sweaters."

End — the twist: Britain tries one last grand gesture, gets moderated, Russia grins, America gives backhanded compliment:
Britain (dramatic): "Okay last pitch: a global day of Independence-themed interpretive dance outside the embassy. Symbolic, unignorable, destabilizing to authoritarian egos."
United Nations (admin): "Britain, slow-mode activated, one message per minute. No flash mobs without permits."
Russia (text, smug): "We will watch your interpretive dance from our balcony and applaud politely."
America (voice, half-laugh): "You talked fast, you caffeinated, you included snacks. Not the plan I asked for, but—good PR. Keep the memes, lose the dance."
Britain (muted for 60s): "(typing) — wait my sweater samples—"
United Nations: "Muted. Case closed. France, you get the culture credit. Britain, inventory your caffeine intake. Meeting adjourned."

Punchline: Britain posts one final emoji before mute — a teacup and a tiny model theatre — and Russia quietly posts a thumbs-up GIF that everyone pretends not to notice.
