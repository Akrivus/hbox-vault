I don't see the character profile attached — could you paste it or tell me which character you want me to write for?

If you’d like, I can pick one from the scene (Taiwan, America, China, Japan, Amazon, or the United Nations) and generate the behavior + 3–5 example quotes in that voice. Tell me which you prefer, or say “surprise me” and I’ll choose.
