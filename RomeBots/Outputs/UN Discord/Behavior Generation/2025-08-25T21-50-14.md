I don't see the character profile attached. Could you paste it (or tell me which character you want — e.g., Taiwan, America, China, Japan, United Nations, Amazon)? 

What I’ll produce once you provide that: a short description of how they behave in this scene (keeping to their quirks, culture, and comic tone) plus 3–5 example lines in their voice. Any other constraints (length, language, or content warnings)?
