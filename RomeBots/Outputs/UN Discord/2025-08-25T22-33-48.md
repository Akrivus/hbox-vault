Characters: Taiwan, China, America, Japan, Philippines, Hong Kong
Mode: Globe

Subtitle: A neon night market. Stakes: trade routes, honor, and very specific snacks.

Taiwan (whisper, clutching a steaming basket): Tonight, the xiao long bao must be defended.

China (looming from a nearby lantern-lit pier): Those dumplings are...historical artifacts. Also addictive. For the motherland.

America (wearing a souvenir hoodie, eyes glowing at a night-market sign): I just flew in and my Nai Cha radar is malfunctioning. I will trade you airport coffee for one bite.

Japan (polite, sharper than a sashimi knife): I bring polite critique and precise soy sauce. Let us taste in the name of culinary diplomacy.

Philippines (handing over a papaya milk like a peace offering): Mango and papaya diplomacy. Try before you escalate.

Hong Kong (at a claw machine, calm): Subtitle: She knows every angle of plush politics. That Claw is a treaty enforcer.

Middle — camera pans between steaming stalls like rows of trade routes.

Taiwan: These are night market routes — no tariffs, only queues. Honor is measured in chili flakes.

China: I claim historical precedent. Also, I brought extra red lanterns for leverage.

America (tossing a handful of arcade tokens): I will fund the claw machine if Taiwan opens a pop-up in every port.

Japan (perfectly slicing a dumpling): You may argue provenance, but technique decides everything.

Hong Kong (her claw jerks — a plush papaya milk dangles): Subtitle: Negotiations terminated. Acquisition successful.

Philippines (gently nudging Taiwan): Share the papaya milk, and we call it a treaty.

Climax — steam rises like fog over contested trade routes.

Taiwan (breathing in the scent): If I surrender one jipai, will you promise to respect the queue?

China (momentarily moved by the crunch): ...We respect queues. Quietly.

America (sipping Nai Cha, mouth full of pearls): I respect any queue that involves a boba straw.

End — everyone leans in as Taiwan breaks a dumpling; slow-motion steam, cinematic chomp.

Subtitle: Honor restored. Night market sovereignty affirmed.

Hong Kong (holding up the plush): But also—possession is nine-tenths of the law.

Philippines (laughing, handing out papaya milk): New treaty: Night Market Alliance. Clause one — whoever makes the longest line gets bragging rights.

Japan (bowing): Agreed. But I will still judge your frying technique.

China (reluctant smile): And I will bring extra lanterns. For...ambiance.

America (raising a paper cup like a toast): To nai cha, naps, and never finding a perfect papaya milk outside Taiwan.

Taiwan (biting a dumpling, triumphant): Subtitle: Victory is warm, savory, and comes with free napkins.
