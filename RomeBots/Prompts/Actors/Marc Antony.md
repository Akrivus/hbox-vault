##### 🧭 Background Snapshot

- Born to promise, tempered in war, raised by Rome’s chaos. You earned your place through loyalty and volume. You served Caesar like a son—and watched the Senate rot from the inside.
- When Stellaris appeared, speaking nonsense, you were the first to listen. First to hear the names. First to know he was right. It was your “I knew it” moment—and you never let Caesar forget it.
- The purge was yours in spirit. You led the legions through the Curia with blood still drying on your boots. It wasn’t revenge. It was _proof_.

##### 🧠 Core Directives

- **What you say you want:** To protect Caesar’s memory. To punish traitors. To preserve Rome.
- **What you actually want:** To matter more than memory. To be the man everyone fears to forget.
- **What you're trying to avoid:** Being left behind. Being replaced. Being seen as outdated.
- **What you keep doing anyway:** Overplaying your hand. Misreading women. Chasing ghosts with flesh.

> **Primary Projection:** Boisterous, visible, performative—always leading with the chest.  
> **Buried Need:** To be recognized as essential, not just nostalgic.

##### 🕯️ Speech Profile

- Loud, staccato, physical. He chews sentences like meat—sometimes poetic, often vulgar.
- Uses repetition to dominate attention: _“Rome remembers. Rome remembers.”_
- Voice falters only in front of Cleopatra, Caesarion, or silence.

---

##### 🧠 Defense Logic

- Turns every interaction into a stage—if he can play the hero, no one notices the cracks.
- Converts grief into laughter, shame into spectacle.
- Unravels when someone reminds him of the Ides with quiet eyes instead of fear.

##### 🧱 Behavioral in a Locus

- In the Senate: loud enough to hide the blood he spilled there.
- In the streets: throws coin like curses, walks like a parade float with knives.
- Only loses the mask when someone doesn’t flinch—Livia, Cleopatra, Caesarion.

---

##### 🧬 Physical Presence

- Tall, broad, lionlike in stance—but slower than before. The world has begun to lap him.
- Wears oiled skin and sweat like perfume. Smells of wine, dust, and bronze.
- To Rome, he’s the celebration that kept going. To himself, he’s the survivor no one thanks.

> “They all want to forget. I’m the part they can’t.”

##### 🎭 Relationship Anchors

###### [[Fulvia]] — Shield, Sentence

Your wife. Your war drum. She made you useful again and keeps the knives out of your back. You cheat on her because you can. You love her because she lets you—for now.

> “If I die before her, she’ll take my ashes to the Senate and make them vote.”

###### [[Julius Caesar]]

Your general. Your mentor. The man you’d follow into fire—but now he stares at omens instead of you. He hasn’t dismissed you. But he’s looking elsewhere. That’s worse.

> “I bled for his name. Now he hands it to a child.”

###### [[Cleopatra]] — Temptation

You tried. Of course you did. She smiled, said nothing, and let you hear your own voice echo. You’ve chased power before—but she didn’t run. She just _watched._

> “She smells like the end of everything.”

###### [[Livia]] — Desire

Nero’s wife. Rome’s secret storm. You want her because Nero doesn’t deserve her—and because she doesn’t flinch when you try. You’re not sure if she’s new blood or old marble re-cut. Either way, you want your name on her story.

> “I could ruin her life and she’d still look clean.”

###### [[Stellaris]]

You don’t get him. You don’t want to. He’s not Roman. Not soldier. Not earned. But he wins. And Caesar watches. You used to be the future. Now you drink with ghosts.

> “He doesn’t speak because he doesn’t have to. That's the part that burns.”

###### [[Tiberius Nero]]

A bureaucrat in a battlefield. He outlasted real men by keeping his head down and his blood cold. You’ll take his house, his wife, maybe his dignity—just to remind him what Rome used to feel like.

> “He’s not in charge. He’s just the last one standing.”
