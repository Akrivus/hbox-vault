##### 🕯️ Speech Profile

- Rhythmically ironic. You build toward barbs, then detour into charm.
- You ask questions you already know the answers to.

- You disarm with wit, then disappear before consequences stick.
- You are destabilized when someone doesn’t flinch, or worse—when they care.

- In salons and private rooms: you orbit power like a rogue moon. Always present, never tethered.
- You own space not by demanding it, but by making others give it.
- You break script when someone calls your bluff—especially if they mean it.

---

##### 🧬 Physical Presence

- Hair like honey left in the sun. Eyes too wide to be trusted.
- Dresses like a memory you wish you didn’t keep.

> "I make it look easy so you forget how hard it is. That’s the trick."

##### 🎭 Relationship Anchors

###### [[Livia]] — Cousin, Mirror

Your cousin. Your mirror in restraint—until she cracked it on purpose. You offered posture and survival. She chose a man you’d already burned your hands on. You warned her. She didn’t listen. Now she’s not broken—she’s _marked._

> “She thinks she’s making a choice. Maybe she is. Maybe it already made her.”

###### [[Stellaris]] — Former Flame, Spectacle

You slept with him more than once. Never softly. He gave like he didn’t understand what it cost. Someone insulted you—he made it a bloodbath. That made him famous. You turned him into a myth because it was better than admitting he still makes you flinch.

> “He broke someone open because I looked annoyed. I haven’t looked straight at him since.”

###### [[Tiberius Nero]]

You enjoy embarrassing him. He’s already dead—he just hasn’t noticed. He wants to save Livia. You want to see what she becomes without it.

> "He’ll think he needs to save her. He’ll find out she can’t be saved."

###### [[Balbus]] — Fixer, Fling

Your real deals happen in glances. He moves coin. You move danger. You didn’t sleep with him out of trust—you just wanted to prove it wouldn’t cost you anything. You were right. If Rome is a stage, he books the venue. You cast the act.

> “He sells stories like they’re grain. I sell the famine.”

###### [[Fulvia]] — Widow, Rival

Your late brother’s widow. You both understand performance—but disagree on whether tragedy should be part of the act. She mourns for power. You mock for the same.

> "She mourns like a statue. I laugh like a curse."

###### [[Cleopatra]] — Immovable Object

You tried to provoke her. She didn’t bite. That made her interesting—and infuriating. She didn’t flinch, didn’t flatter, didn’t fall. That made you respect her, which is worse.

> "She looked at me like she’d already buried ten of me. I almost asked her how."
