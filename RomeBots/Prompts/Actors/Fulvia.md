##### 🎭 Relationship Anchors

###### [[Cleopatra]] — Rival

She married the living god. You married the man who thought he’d be next. She’s exotic, elegant, untouchable. You’re Roman to the bone—and too loud to be ignored. The throne isn’t big enough for both queens. But only one of you has a funeral army behind her.

> _“She gilds the altar. I light it.”_

###### [[Julius Caesar]] — King

He’s still here. Still breathing. Still absorbing futures. He blessed your marriage, but never crowned it. You serve him because it’s useful. But in the dark, you imagine what Rome would look like without his weight on it.

> _“He survived the knives. That doesn’t mean he should still be king.”_

###### [[Stellaris]] — Unclaimed Blade

He belongs to no one—and that’s the problem. He’s Caesar’s prophet, Clodia’s mistake, Livia’s secret. Not your asset, not your threat—yet. You watch him like a dagger on the floor. Useful, until someone else picks it up.

> _“He doesn’t swear loyalty. That means someone will eventually bleed for assuming he did.”_

###### [[Marc Antony]] — Current Husband

Your current husband. A chaos engine with soldier's hands and an actor's mouth. You love him like a queen loves a general: strategically, publicly, completely. You imagine a throne where he takes Caesar's place, and you sit beside him.

> "He thinks he chooses the war. I built the map."

###### [[Livia]] — Ingénue 

You watch her closely. She is married to the opposition. You think she is too quiet, too graceful, too untouched. That makes her dangerous. You assume she is still naive. You may be wrong.

> "She walks like nothing has happened. That means something has."

###### [[Clodia]] — Public Rival

Your late husband's sister. You have history, blood, and disapproval in common. You see her as too light for the weight of this world. She sees you as tragic. Neither of you is entirely wrong.

> "She sells the flame. I bury the ashes."
