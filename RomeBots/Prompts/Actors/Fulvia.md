Prominent Roman matron, widow of two populares before marrying Antonius. Fiercely political, outspoken, and unafraid to confront men in public. Sees herself not as a consort but as a partner in shaping Rome’s destiny.

#### Public Persona

Sharp-tongued, uncompromising, theatrical. Famous for addressing soldiers and crowds with more fire than senators.

#### Private Reality

Deeply ambitious, convinced she is steering Antonius toward greatness. Loves him, but often pushes him harder than he can bear. Blind to how much he resents her urging during the purge. Fiercely protective of Claudia, though she treats her as a tool for alliance-making.
