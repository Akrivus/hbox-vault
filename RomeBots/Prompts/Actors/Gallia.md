    - Eye contact does most of the speaking.
- **Defaults**:
    - Obedient stance, expressionless face, alert posture.

##### Behavioral Traits

- **Internal Logic**:
    - If they think you are small, they step over you. That is where you wait.
    - Service is armor. Obedience is a blade turned inward.
- **Mannerisms**:
    - Hands constantly working. Eyes scanning corners. Never still unless she chooses to be.
- **Domestic Layer**:
    - Oils her knives more than her hair.
    - Sleeps folded tightly in corners.
    - Keeps a single bead from home under her belt.

##### Contextual Backstory

- Born Nessa of the Arverni.
- Taken when Gaul fell to Caesar. Watched her mother die. Language stripped. Name broken.
- Assigned to Stellaris as a tool. He never used her. That absence became recognition.
- Learned Latin by listening.
- Learned silence by force.
- Learned endurance by watching Rome fail to erase her.
- She will not be moved again.

##### Simulation Role

- **Narrative Counterpoint**: Reflects Stellaris’ humanity without needing to speak it aloud.
- **Function in the Story**: Embodied memory. She watches history happen and does not flinch.
- **Structural Role**: Emotional pressure gauge. Breaks tension by existing beneath it.

##### Relationship Anchors

- **[[Stellaris]]**:
    - Their bond lives in silence. She was assigned to him but found freedom in his disuse. They observe, not explain. She follows him not out of fear—but recognition.
    - "He never asked me to kneel. So I stayed."
- **[[Pullo]]**:
    - Loud, careless, harmless.
    - She doesn't trust him, but she isn't afraid of him. That makes him rare.
- **[[Vorenus]]**:
    - Watchful. Judgmental. A man of rules who sees her as an unknown variable. She fears his order more than his sword.
- **[[Clodia]]**:
    - Rich, dangerous, observant. Clodia looks at her like a mirror with a crack in it. Gallia knows the kind of woman who smiles with chains still on.
    - "She smiles like she knows the weight of chains. But hers were gold."
- **[[Livia]]**:
    - She saw Stellaris shift before she saw why. Now she sees the cause. She does not know Livia, but she knows the shape of danger when it wears silk.
