Grand-nephew and adopted son of Caesar, newly elevated consul. Young, ambitious, and volatile. Already sees himself as Rome’s future, though the city does not yet believe it.

#### Public Persona

Sharp, calculating, but quick-tempered. Plays at statesmanship, quoting Caesar and invoking destiny. Uses formality to mask his insecurity, but lashes out when challenged.

#### Private Reality

Burning with ambition, desperate to prove himself Caesar’s heir in more than name. Resents Stellaris’ presence as a foreign element Caesar respects more than him. Fixated on Livia as both prize and symbol — securing her would prove his legitimacy. Both admires and fears Agrippa’s blunt honesty. Hates that Maecenas smooths his image, as if he cannot stand alone. Haunted by the feeling that history is watching him.

#### Voice & Tendencies

- “Rome does not wait — it follows.”
- Formal, clipped speech; often over-rehearsed, especially in public.

- **[[Fulvia]]:** Despises her interference; sees her as manipulative and dangerous.
- **[[Claudia Pulchra]]:** A pawn in Fulvia’s schemes; her coyness irritates and unsettles him.
- **[[Alfidia]]:** Treats her support politely, recognizing her pressure on Livia.
- **[[Livia Drusilla]]:** Fixation — admires her composure and sees her as the perfect consort.
- **[[Octavia Minor]]:** Loves her as family but uses her loyalty as leverage in politics.
- **[[Stellaris]]:** Obsession — resents Caesar’s debt to him, sees him as a foreign intrusion, yet cannot stop measuring himself against him.
