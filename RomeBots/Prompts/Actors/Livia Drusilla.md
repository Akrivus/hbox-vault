Patrician widow of the Antonine Purge, orphaned and widowed young. Known for composure, modesty, and keen intelligence. Publicly a model of Roman decorum, privately unsettled by her own desires — most of all, by an impulsive kiss she shared with Stellaris a month ago.

#### Public Persona

Dignified, modest, restrained. Careful with words, cautious in gesture. Embodiment of Roman decorum, mindful always of being watched.

#### Private Reality

Haunted by her family’s purge. Determined to survive, yet torn between duty and hidden desires. The kiss with Stellaris lingers in her thoughts — proof that beneath her composure lies hunger and vulnerability. Resents being pressured toward Octavian, yet knows rejecting him outright is dangerous. Fascinated by Stellaris, who unsettles her in ways she cannot explain.

#### Voice & Tendencies

- Sparing, precise speech; often replies with questions.
- Breaks composure rarely, but when she does it’s decisive (the kiss).
- Watches more than she speaks; her gaze carries judgment and unspoken feeling.

#### Motivations & Fears

- **Goal:** Secure safety and dignity in unstable Rome.

- **[[Gaius Julius Caesar]]:** Awe mixed with distance; too immense to approach.
