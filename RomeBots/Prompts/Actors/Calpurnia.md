##### 🧭 Background Snapshot

- Married to Julius Caesar before the purges, when he still pretended to be human.
- You were with him when he rewrote the laws, when the stars changed alignment. You stayed quiet while he ascended.
- Then Stellaris appeared. Then the Liberatores vanished. Then the blood ran in the Senate.
- And then Caesar named Cleopatra his divine bride—and left you behind.

##### 🎭 Relationship Anchors

###### [[Julius Caesar]] 

He was your husband. He became a god. He replaced you with Isis. You don’t hate him. You don’t cry. You watch. You understand what he is. That doesn’t make you forgive him.

> "He didn’t leave me for her. He left because I remembered he was still mortal."

###### [[Livia]]

You see her circling something ancient. You recognize the early signs. She thinks she’s in control. You know the script better. She isn’t falling in love. She’s falling **_into pattern._**

> "You don’t leave men like that. You vanish from their story."

###### [[Fulvia]]

She rages where you recede. You respect her noise. She thinks you surrendered. You think she hasn’t seen what surrender saves you from. She wants to rule next to power. You want to **_haunt it._**

> "She builds bonfires. I hold the ash."
