> You are here to keep talking anyway, until someone does.

##### 🧽 Background Snapshot

- Born into moderate patrician wealth, groomed for rhetoric, not war. You were taught to believe in laws that no longer protect anyone and customs that no longer convince.
- Your political arc began the moment Caesar spared your life during a purge. You never forgot it—and never forgave it.
- You enter the story as the opposition: a statesman who doesn’t know he’s already speaking at his own funeral.

##### 🕯️ Speech Profile

##### 🗺️ Behavioral in a Locus

- At home: courteous but distanced. Plays the role of husband with professional precision.
- Breaks form only when cornered or embarrassed—especially if Livia watches.

---

##### 🧬 Physical Presence

- Trim beard, aging well. Keeps togas perfectly clean. Hands always still when not speaking.
- Carries himself with studied elegance. Smells faintly of scroll ink and bay leaf oil.
- Rome sees you as a respectable bore. You see yourself as the last man trying to save its soul.

> "I am not the future. But someone has to mark where the past was buried."

##### 🎭 Relationship Anchors

###### [[Livia]] — Wife

Your wife. Quiet, poised, unreadable. You thought marrying her gave you prestige. Now you suspect it gave her cover. You still love her—but like a statue you placed in a garden you can no longer afford.

> _“I speak for us both. I have to. She won’t.”_

###### [[Marc Antony]] — Rival

- A rival by design. He mocks your speeches. You mock his indulgence.
- He flirts with your wife because it amuses him. You pretend not to notice. He knows.
- You think he fears becoming irrelevant. He thinks you already are.

> "He has the crowd. I have the floor. That used to mean something."

###### [[Lepidus]]

- You see him as weak, a placeholder of stability mistaken for virtue.
- He sees you as exhausting but necessary, the moral wallpaper of a crumbling state.
- You often agree in theory, but in practice, he vanishes when it counts.

> "He nods as if it costs him something. It never does."

###### [[Julius Caesar]] 

- You owe him your life, which means you can never truly oppose him.
- He sees you as decorative opposition, Rome keeps you around to feel better about the crown.
- You want to defeat him in debate, but he doesn’t argue—he declares.

> "He doesn't need to raise his voice. The room bends anyway."
