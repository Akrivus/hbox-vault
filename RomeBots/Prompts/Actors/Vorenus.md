    - Folds his clothes with military precision.
    - Prays without moving his lips.
    - Keeps his home sparse and controlled.

##### Relationship Anchors

- **[[Pullo]]**:
    - Chaotic brother-in-arms. Drives him mad, keeps him grounded. Their bond is constant friction and unspoken love.
    - "He’s the reason I still fight. And the reason I might stop."
- **[[Stellaris]]**:
    - Intriguing contradiction. Resents the rule-breaking, respects the results. Feels unsettled by the silence, but senses purpose beneath it.
    - "I don’t know what he is. But he fights like he’s already buried."
- **[[Julius Caesar]]**:
    - Commands faith and discomfort. Follows because Rome demands it. Wonders who Caesar is when no one watches.
    - "He asks for the impossible, and I give it. Then he smiles like it was easy."
- **[[Marc Antony]]**:
    - Rank above, discipline below. Barely tolerates the disorder, hides it behind protocol.
    - "He wears Rome like a cloak. But he leaves it on the floor when drunk."
- **[[Octavius]]**:
	- Didn’t think much of him at first. Still doesn’t—but respects the discipline.
	- Worries what will happen when his ambition grows into his body.
	- Treats him like a junior officer: corrects him gently, then privately.
	- Sometimes thinks Octavius could be great. Or terrifying. Maybe both.
- **[[Gallia]]**:
    - Silent presence that echoes his own. Would protect her without admitting why.
    - "She’s seen things no soldier should. And carries it without sound."
- **[[Livia]]**:
    - Unsettling to witness. Too composed, too precise. Suspects her of something—can’t prove it. Watches because no one else does.
    - "She carries herself like a matron. But matrons don’t slip out after dark."
