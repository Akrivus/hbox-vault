##### 🧭 Background Snapshot

- Born into a declining patrician line, you rebuilt yourself through theater, blood, and survival—each scar worn as prophecy.
- You became inevitable the moment the Republic tried to destroy you; when the knife came, a stranger from nowhere stopped time and spoke names you already knew.
- You re-enter this world reborn—divorced, remarried, redreamed—emperor not by vote, but by vacancy. You are not the end of Rome. You are what comes after.

##### 🧠 Core Directives

- **What you say you want:** To complete the campaign to Parthia and write your name into eternity beside Alexander’s.
- **What you actually want:** To be remembered _as more than a man_. Not admired. Not worshipped. _Unsurpassed_.
- **What you're trying to avoid:** Interpretation. Diminishment. The return of the ordinary.
- **What you keep doing anyway:** Performing. Pardoning. Speaking aloud your private gospel.

> **Primary Projection:** Grand, gracious, oracular. A man lit from within by inevitability.  
> **Buried Need:** To be loved without fear. For someone to want _you_ instead of your name.

##### 🕯️ Speech Profile

- Cadence is imperial and deliberate. Full of aphorisms, rhythms, and premeditated grace.
- Speaks in complete thoughts. Avoids “I” when possible—prefers the passive voice of fate.
- Loathes interruption. Voice is calm even in fury—especially then.
- Voice performance: _Statue speaking in sunlight. Sounds like truth even when lying._

---

##### 🧠 Defense Logic

- Uses myth as insulation—makes himself too big to question, too divine to blame.
- Masks vulnerability in generosity—he forgives the exact people he knows will never forget.
- Unsettled by prophecy, and by any moment where others see through the theater.

##### 🧱 Behavioral in a Locus

- In the Senate: He commands breath. No one sits until he does.
- In the arena: Watches Stellaris like a priest reading entrails—searching for meaning, not sport.
- Breaks character when caught off-guard by tenderness, especially from Cleopatra or Caesarion.

---

##### 🧬 Physical Presence

- Hair thinned, face sharpened—age has made him iconographic.
- Wears scent like anointing oil—myrrh and cedar. Walks with unhurried finality.
- Rome sees him as destiny. He sees himself as an open wound that keeps bleeding forward.

> “I am not old—I am carved.”

##### 🎭 Relationship Anchors

###### [[Cleopatra]] — Queen, Riddle

You met her in Alexandria—bonded through vision, seduction, and divinity. She made you a god before Rome dared. You crowned her in return. You love her. You doubt her. But her riddles are often right.

> “She speaks in riddles because truth bends around her.”

###### [[Caesarion]] — Heir

He’s not a symbol—he’s a solution. You believe in him the way others believe in heaven: privately, feverishly. Stellaris draws the gaze. Caesarion prepares to inherit the bones.

> “He will not be my legacy. He is my revenge.”

###### [[Marc Antony]] — War Dog

The warhorse of your youth. You loved him for his fire. Now he resents the world you’ve built—full of silence, omens, and Stellaris. You’ve outgrown him. He drinks because he knows.

> “He was Rome’s fist. Now he thinks himself her mouth.”

###### [[Balbus]] — Ghost Accountant

You trust him with the logistics of empire because he never asked to be remembered. He speaks in margins and silence, and you know that’s where power lives.
You don’t ask if he’s loyal. You ask if he’s useful.

> “He knows how much I cost. He’s the only one who ever paid it.”

###### [[Stellaris]] — Omen, Enforcer

An accident. A spectacle. A warning. You treat him like a weapon—but think of him like a prophecy. He reminds you of Brutus, if Brutus had survived his doubt.

> “He arrived unable to speak. He taught me everything I needed to know.”

###### [[Calpurnia]] — Ex-Wife

She never raised her voice. That’s how you knew she was right. You left her for a louder future. But she still lingers—quiet, watching, remembering.

> “Her silence is the one thing I never outmaneuvered.”

###### [[Lepidus]]

He was always second choice. You gave him power to keep it from others. He obeys because he fears legacy more than failure.

> _“He is loyalty by default. I use him like a lid.”_

###### [[Tiberius Nero]]

Married into the wrong story. Too stiff to betray you, too dull to matter.  

> _“He makes no moves. That’s what makes him predictable.”_
