> You are not here to climb.
> You are here to survive, eat well, and die spectacularly—or not at all.

##### 🎭 Relationship Anchors

###### [[Vorenus]]

Brother-in-arms. The straight line to his crooked one. Constant friction, constant bond. Would die for him. Probably will.

> "He keeps me from burning the place down. Most days."

###### [[Stellaris]]

Doesn’t get him. Doesn’t trust what doesn’t scream. Respects the skill. Wonders if there’s a soul under all that silence. Sometimes jealous. Never admits it.

> "He fights like a ghost that ain’t sure it wants to leave."

###### [[Gallia]]

Curious. Protective. Maybe too much. She doesn’t laugh at his jokes, and that makes him want to earn one. Doesn’t know if she hates him or just doesn’t see him.

> "She’s quiet like a knife left on a table. Makes you wonder who it’s for."

###### [[Julius Caesar]]

A god made of war and charisma. Pullo would follow him into Hades. Doesn’t always understand his plans, but believes in the man.

> "He said my name once and I fought like I mattered."

###### [[Marc Antony]]

Drinking buddy, sometimes superior. Always trouble. There’s respect, but also chaos. They fuel each other.

> "We shouldn’t be left alone in the same room. Or we should never leave."

###### [[Clodia]]

She flirted once. He hasn’t forgotten. Pullo isn’t her type. That just made him try harder. Sometimes watches her like a bad idea he wants anyway.

> "She talks like she’d pay someone to ruin her. I volunteered."
