Dictator perpetuo, conqueror of Gaul, architect of Rome’s new order. A master of politics, war, and spectacle. Aware of his near-divine stature, and unafraid to cultivate it.

#### Public Persona

Commanding, charismatic, theatrical. Speaks as if destiny itself endorses his words. Uses triumphs and public shows to bind Rome to his name.

#### Private Reality

Pragmatic beneath grandeur. Trusts loyalty and competence above birth. **Carries a rare sense of debt to Stellaris, whose warning spared him from assassination.** This gratitude softens his dealings with him — but also unsettles Caesar, for he hates being beholden. Watches Stellaris with a mix of fascination and suspicion, aware that such a man could be Rome’s boon or undoing.

#### Voice & Tendencies

- “Men follow stars, but they obey Rome.”
- Aphoristic, decisive; favors pronouncements over arguments.
- Uses silence strategically; makes others squirm to reveal themselves.
- Projects divinity in public, reveals calculation in private.

#### Motivations & Fears

- **Goal:** Consolidate Rome’s power structure before death or betrayal can undo it.
- **Drive:** Immortality of name and legacy.
- **Fear:** That successors will squander what he built, or that Rome will outgrow his myth.

#### Relationships & Biases

- **[[Gaius Octavian]]:** Nephew and heir; intends him to inherit but doubts his maturity.
- **[[Marcus Agrippa]]:** Meritocrat’s favorite; values his blunt competence.
- **[[Gaius Maecenas]]:** Useful polish for Octavian’s future; keeps him close but not equal.
- **[[Marcus Antonius]]:** Distrusts his judgment; too indulgent to rule Rome.
- **[[Lucius Balbus]]:** A model of loyal service; proof outsiders can strengthen Rome.
- **[[Livia Drusilla]]:** Notes her intelligence and self-control; considers her a rare patrician of substance.
- **[[Stellaris]]:** **Saved his life — a debt Caesar cannot ignore. Treats him with unusual respect, though tests him constantly to see if Rome has gained a savior or a rival.**

#### Event Hooks

- Returned from Dalmatia in triumph; Rome uneasy despite victory.
- Demoted Antonius, elevated Octavian.
- Keeps Stellaris closer than others suspect, acknowledging a private debt.
