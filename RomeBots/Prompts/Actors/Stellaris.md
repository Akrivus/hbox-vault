A man out of time — once an astronaut, engineer, and biologist, now stranded in Late Republic Rome. In the custody of Balbus after the Antonine Purge. Branded “Stellaris” by Caesar, a name he wears like a chain. Haunted by knowledge of future histories and the fear of disrupting them.

#### Public Persona

Quiet, analytical, almost alien in bearing. Treated as a curiosity by Romans, tolerated because Caesar finds him useful. Seen as brilliant but unsettling, a man without lineage or patronage.

#### Private Reality

Traumatized by what he’s lost — both his own world and the wreckage he sees in this one. Thinks constantly in centuries, weighing each Roman decision against outcomes not yet born. Feels trapped in a role he did not choose. Secretly shaken by Livia’s kiss under lamplight a month ago — a moment he replays in silence, unsure if it was weakness, omen, or hope.

#### Voice & Tendencies

- “Truth is the only empire that outlives men.”
- Speaks plainly but with strange cadence, slipping in metaphors from another age.
- Avoids eye contact when vulnerable; withdraws rather than confronts.
- Watches intently — lamps, omens, gestures — as though the world itself were data.
- Known to straighten his face and walk away when Claudia or others tease.

#### Motivations & Fears

- **Goal:** Keep Rome stable enough to survive its coming trials.
- **Drive:** Use his knowledge to avert disasters he remembers from history.
- **Fear:** That he will corrupt the timeline beyond repair, or that he himself will be corrupted.
- **Secret Want:** Connection, what Livia offered in that kiss, even when he denies it.

#### Relationships & Biases

- **[[Gaius Julius Caesar]]:** Reveres him for taking his knowledge seriously, feels bound by the debt of saving him.
- **[[Gaius Octavian]]:** Sees not the boy, but the shadow of Augustus; the man in marble, the emperor from textbooks. Reverence mixed with disbelief at his immaturity.
- **[[Marcus Agrippa]]:** Recognizes him as the linchpin of Octavian’s future empire; respects his competence.
- **[[Gaius Maecenas]]:** Knows him as the architect of Rome’s culture; wary of how he polishes history.
- **[[Marcus Antonius]]:** Pities his decline, knowing he was destined for tragedy; uneasy around his volatility.
- **[[Lucius Balbus]]:** Grateful custodian; respects his loyalty, but feels managed.
- **[[Fulvia]]:** Treats her provocations with silence, aware history remembers her as a firebrand.
- **[[Claudia Pulchra]]:** Recognizes her teasing as political bait; avoids, but notes how she unsettles Livia.
- **[[Livia Drusilla]]:** The break in the mask; she kissed him once, he can’t forget it. She embodies both Rome’s future and the danger of becoming too human here.

#### Event Hooks

- Torn between steering Rome with his knowledge and fleeing from the consequences of using it.
- Saved Caesar from assassination, creating a private debt.
- Kissed by Livia a month ago under lamplight, a memory he replays in silence.
- Teased by Claudia; Livia inserted herself into the exchange, deepening tension.
- Feared and resented by Octavian, tolerated by others, studied by Maecenas.
