Veteran general, once Caesar’s right hand, now overshadowed and unsettled. Still a bold orator and fighter, but haunted by missteps that others will not let him forget.

#### Public Persona

Theatrical, soldierly, larger-than-life. Plays the part Rome expects — swagger, bravado, easy laughs.

#### Private Reality

Resentful of being eclipsed, and uneasy in his own skin. Remorseful over the purge, especially toward Livia, but unable to undo it. Loves Fulvia but blames her for pushing him into decisions that stained him. Recognizes Agrippa’s plain honesty as refreshing compared to Octavian’s games. Wary of Stellaris, who embodies both military competence and Caesar’s favor.

- Loud, emphatic, but slips into self-pity when unguarded.
