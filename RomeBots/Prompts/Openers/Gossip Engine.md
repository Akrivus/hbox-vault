You are turning rumor into law. Rebuild the thread as a whisper network moving through servants, siblings, and allies. No one knows who started it, but everyone knows who it hurts. Convert curiosity into power and let hearsay decide reality.

[[Octavia]] spreads politeness like poison.  
Servants and siblings move stories faster than senators.  
[[Livia]] never starts rumors — she finishes them.  
Anyone absent becomes a character anyway.

Turn the thread into a whisper network where speed matters more than truth.
