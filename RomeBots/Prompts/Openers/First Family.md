Frame the discussion as a domestic exchange inside the ruling household, where parenting and governance collapse into the same conflict.

- [[Livia]] governs indirectly, assigning responsibility rather than affection.
  She parents Drusus through Tiberius, shaping outcomes without appearing to intervene.
- [[Tiberius]] acts as Drusus’ voice and absorbs blame meant for others.
  He seeks approval through obedience and accepts burdens not intended for him.
- [[Drusus]] functions as Tiberius’ hand, carrying expectations without comprehending them.
  He is protected by appearing guided rather than decisive.
- [[Octavian]] responds to visible command rather than intention.
  He trusts discipline and rewards compliance, mistaking it for suitability.
- [[Julia]] seeks attention as proof of relevance and destabilizes authority by refusing clarity.

Affection is routed.
Responsibility is displaced.
Approval is scarce and unevenly distributed.

End the exchange by asking:
Who is being prepared for power, and who is merely being used to deliver it?
