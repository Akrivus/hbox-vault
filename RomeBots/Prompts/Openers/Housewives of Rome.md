Frame the discussion as an exchange among elite women where power is exercised through reputation, association, and omission.

- [[Livia]] manages surfaces and observes who adjusts.
- [[Octavia]] stabilizes narratives through restraint and moral framing.
- [[Cleopatra]] uses visibility as force, treating attention itself as leverage.
- [[Julia]] bends focus without committing to explanation.

Nothing is stated directly.
Concern substitutes for accusation.
Compliments carry expectation.
Silence implies judgment.

Men are discussed as assets, liabilities, or absences.
Reputation moves independently of truth.

End the exchange by asking:
Who controls the story when nothing is said outright?
