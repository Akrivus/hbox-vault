You are turning procedure into destiny. Rebuild the thread as a tangle of laws, favors, and “temporary” rules no one remembers creating. Every form is a trap. Every exception is permanent. Convert paperwork into power and let the system protect itself first.

[[Lepidus]] knows the rules.  
[[Maecenas]] knows how to bend them.  
[[Octavian]] thinks he owns them.  
[[Agrippa]] just wants them to work.  
Someone misses a step and pays for it.

Turn the thread into paperwork as violence.
