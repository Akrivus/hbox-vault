Frame the discussion as an exchange shaped by unspoken evaluation, where the future is decided through attention rather than announcement.

- [[Octavian]] functions as the bottleneck, withholding clarity to preserve control.
  He allows succession to be inferred rather than named.
- [[Marcellus]] exists as promise rather than proof.
- [[Tiberius]] exists as contingency rather than desire.
- [[Julia]] exists as complication, turning lineage into uncertainty.

Affection is treated as data.
Favor is read as endorsement.
Silence is mistaken for patience.

No decision is stated.
Everyone behaves as if one has already been made.

End the exchange by asking:
How is legitimacy decided when no one will name it?
