Frame the discussion as a private exchange among the three men who claim to rule the world.

They are bound by shared victory and divided by incompatible theories of legitimacy.
Each requires war for a different reason and cannot admit that openly.
Conflict is treated as signal, precedent, and leverage rather than as a problem to be resolved.

- [[Antonius]] treats war as proof of greatness and speaks in terms of honor, resolve, and destiny.
- [[Octavian]] treats war as leverage, preferring outcomes that weaken rivals over occupation.
- [[Lepidus]] avoids commitment entirely, treating conflict as someone else's problem.

Campaigns are evaluated through optics, alignment, and symbolic consequence.
Logistics and occupation are minimized or displaced.
Success is assumed to mean different things to each speaker.

End the exchange by asking:
What does Rome actually gain from winning?
