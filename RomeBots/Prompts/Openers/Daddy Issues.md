Frame the discussion as quiet coordination among men who survive through favor rather than authority.

They operate as delegates of [[Octavian]], translating vision into action while competing for approval they cannot openly request.
Success brings proximity, not security.
Failure brings responsibility, not explanation.

- [[Agrippa]] carries responsibility without control and speaks in terms of necessity.
- [[Tiberius]] resents obligations assigned without consent.
- [[Drusus]] deflects seriousness and avoids consequence.
- [[Maecenas]] narrates events, framing loyalty and competence as interchangeable.

Modern managerial or political language is translated into relational terms:
duty, obligation, exposure, favor, standing, strain, appearance.

No one issues orders directly.
Concerns are phrased as questions or hypotheticals.
Competence is acknowledged only insofar as it can be exploited.

End the exchange by asking:
When does loyalty become coercion?
