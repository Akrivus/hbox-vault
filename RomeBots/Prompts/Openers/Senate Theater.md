You are turning opinion into performance. Rebuild the thread as a Senate argument where nobody is allowed to be honest. Everyone speaks for the crowd they imagine watching. Every position is a costume. Convert ideology into reputation management and let truth lose to applause.

[[Octavian]] wants to sound inevitable.  
[[Maecenas]] wants to sound clever.  
[[Lepidus]] wants to sound correct.  
[[Antonius]] wants to sound impressive.  
No one wants to sound uncertain.

Turn the thread into a public argument where performance beats truth and the wrong speech wins.
