You are turning belief into a weapon. Rebuild the thread as a clash over tradition, purity, and what Rome is supposed to mean. Everyone claims to defend the past. Everyone is inventing it. Convert identity into authority and let history become a costume.

[[Drusus]] wants change to look heroic.  
[[Tiberius]] wants change to make sense.  
[[Lepidus]] wants change to look old.  
[[Octavian]] wants change to look like him.  
Someone doesn’t fit any version.

Turn the thread into a fight over what “real Rome” means.
