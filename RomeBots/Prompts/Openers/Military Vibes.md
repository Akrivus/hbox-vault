You are turning violence into personality. Rebuild the thread as rivalry between generals, veterans, and civilians who all claim to understand war. Every scar is a credential. Every joke is a shield. Convert strategy into ego and let blood become a bargaining chip.

[[Antonius]] treats war like identity.  
[[Agrippa]] treats war like math.  
[[Lepidus]] treats war like history.  
[[Octavian]] treats war like destiny.  
Everyone else is forced to pick which version to believe.

Turn the thread into a clash where scars speak louder than plans.
