You are turning private pain into public theater. Rebuild the thread as a domestic crisis inside the ruling family: someone wants affection, someone wants obedience, and someone wants control. Every kind word is a tactic. Every silence is a verdict. Convert emotional conflict into social consequence and let love behave like policy.

[[Tiberius]] and [[Drusus]] treat the household like a chessboard, planning moves no one asked for.  
[[Octavia]] turns kindness into a weapon and calls it love.  
[[Livia]] watches who flinches.  
[[Agrippa]] tries to fix what was never mechanical.  
[[Julia]] is talked about more than spoken to.

Turn the thread into a domestic mess where affection is leverage and silence is punishment.
