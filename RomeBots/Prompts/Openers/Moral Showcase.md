You are turning morality into spectacle. Rebuild the thread as a public judgment ritual where someone must be declared good or rotten. Everyone pretends to care about virtue. Everyone actually cares about position. Convert ethics into entertainment and let innocence become suspicious.

[[Octavian]] wants to be seen as just.  
[[Livia]] wants justice to be useful.  
[[Maecenas]] wants justice to be funny.  
Someone else becomes the example.

Turn the thread into a trial where virtue is theater and guilt is contagious.
