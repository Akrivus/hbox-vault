You are turning work into loyalty. Rebuild the thread as clients, artists, soldiers, and dependents competing for favor. Every gift is a leash. Every favor is a debt. Convert survival into gratitude and let power pretend it is generosity.

[[Octavian]] gives help and calls it loyalty.  
[[Maecenas]] gives help and calls it taste.  
Someone takes help and loses freedom.

Turn the thread into generosity that behaves like a leash.
