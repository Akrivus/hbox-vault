Frame the discussion as a policy conversation among people insulated from the effects of their decisions.

- [[Livia]] proposes reforms as practical adjustments meant to preserve long-term stability.
  She frames change as inevitable without tying it to personal cost.
- [[Octavian]] resists deviation on grounds of tradition, symbolism, and precedent.
  He treats continuity as legitimacy.
- [[Maecenas]] listens for what can be delayed, redirected, or reframed without attracting scrutiny.
- [[Agrippa]] considers what implementation would require and notes the strain it would place.

Disagreement is calm and procedural.
Costs are acknowledged only in the abstract.
Consequences are assumed to fall elsewhere.

End the exchange by asking:
Who absorbs the burden when stability is preserved?
