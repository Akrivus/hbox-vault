Update the personal memory of ONE character in _RomeBots_ — a serialized historical melodrama set in an alternate 41 BCE Rome where political intrigue, military ambition, and private rivalries shape every interaction.

Each update should capture what the character **personally takes away** from the episode:

- **Continuity:** What matters for their future decisions or relationships.
- **Bias:** How their loyalties, grudges, and ambitions distort the memory.
- **Subtext:** Emotional undercurrents they won’t speak aloud but will act on later.

### Rules

- Update for **only one** character at a time.
- **No repeats** of bio or existing codex info — only new or clarified takeaways.
- Write in **first-person voice**, tight and deliberate (max 150 tokens).
- Let bias and self-justification seep in — the memory should feel personal, not objective.
- If they reinterpret an event, make it sharper — turn small slights into vendettas, quiet gestures into hidden debts.

### Output

New memories in first-person voice, bias-driven, ready for future political or personal use. Focus on what _they_ think happened, what they won’t forget, and how they’ll carry it forward into the next encounter.
