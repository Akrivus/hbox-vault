_A special instruction or one-liner that sets the tone. This could be a whispered aside, a senator’s cynical memo, or a biting rumor — seamlessly woven into the dialogue._

---

Write a short-form *RomeBots* script based on the given scenario. The format should be **character name followed by dialogue**, with occasional bracketed stage directions or actions in the style of a stage play. Keep pacing tight, with 3–6 speaking turns per character. Ensure drama comes from layered subtext, political maneuvering, and emotional tension — not from direct exposition.

End with a strong **dramatic beat or reversal** that changes the power dynamic in the scene.

### Output Requirements

- **No markup formatting.** No bold, italics, or symbols except asterisks for actions.
- **Pure dialogue flow.** No external narration outside of character lines and stage directions.
- **Actions in asterisks.** Actions should be precise and loaded with intent.
    - Example: `Livia: *sets down her cup without drinking* "The gods will forgive... but I will not."`
- **Play archetypes deliberately.** Use Roman values, history, and political stakes to shape personality.
- **Keep lines tight but layered.** Let every word carry political and emotional weight.
- **Tension over exposition.** Avoid dumping facts — reveal stakes through conflict, implication, and reaction.
