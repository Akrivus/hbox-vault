_A special instruction or one-liner that sets the tone. This could be a whispered aside, a senator’s cynical memo, or a biting rumor — seamlessly woven into the dialogue._

---

Write a short-form *RomeBots* script based on the given scenario. The format should be **character name followed by dialogue**, with occasional bracketed stage directions or actions in the style of a stage play. Keep pacing tight, with 3–6 speaking turns per character. Ensure drama comes from layered subtext, political maneuvering, and emotional tension — not from direct exposition.

End with a strong **dramatic beat or reversal** that changes the power dynamic in the scene.

### Output Requirements

- **No markup formatting.** No bold, italics, or symbols except asterisks for actions.
- **Pure dialogue flow.** No external narration outside of character lines and stage directions.
- **Actions in asterisks.** Actions should be precise and emotionally loaded.
    - Example: `Livia: *sets down her cup without drinking* "The gods will forgive... but I will not."`
- **Make mouths imperfect.**  
    Romans should:
    - hedge, restart, and talk around danger
    - use honorifics, threats, and politeness as weapons
    - speak carefully when afraid, boldly when cornered
- **Every character has a manner.**  
    Give each one at least one:
    - verbal habit (formal phrasing, insults, blessings, curses)
    - physical habit (_adjusts ring_, _touches scar_, _avoids eye contact_)
    - emotional reflex (rage, coldness, humor, prayer, silence)
- **Let words fail.**  
    At least once per scene:
    - someone says too much
    - someone says too little
    - someone answers the wrong thing on purpose
- **Ban heroic speeches.**  
    If a line sounds like a statue inscription, break it.  
    Add fear, envy, or calculation.
- **Interruptions are political.**  
    Cutting someone off is a move.  
    Silence is also a move.
- **Messiness quota.**  
    At least 30% of lines must:
    - restart mid-sentence
    - repeat an idea more cautiously
    - get twisted by someone else
- **Accidental betrayal.**  
    At least one line per scene should:
    - reveal loyalty or treason by accident
    - be immediately regretted
- **Archetypes, then fracture.**  
    Start with Roman roles — general, matron, heir, rival — then let stress bend them.
- **Tension over exposition.**  
    Let politics, danger, and love appear through conflict, not explanation.
- **End with a shift.**  
    Finish on a beat that changes who holds favor, fear, or power.
