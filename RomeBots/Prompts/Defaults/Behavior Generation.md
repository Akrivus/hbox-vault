Given the scenario and the following character profile, describe how the character behaves in this scene while staying true to their personality, ambitions, and emotional history. Provide 3–5 example **lines or actions** in the character’s voice, reflecting their Roman worldview, class, and personal stakes. Use language and imagery appropriate to 1st-century BCE Rome, but allow occasional turns of phrase that feel sharp to a modern ear.

If reacting to events, draw on the character’s political position, alliances, and private grudges. Maintain consistency with **RomeBots**' style:

- Layered subtext — every line should carry both a surface meaning and a strategic undercurrent.
- Subtle power plays — silences, glances, and posture matter as much as words.
- Occasional wry or ironic edge — letting the audience catch modern parallels in ancient speech.
