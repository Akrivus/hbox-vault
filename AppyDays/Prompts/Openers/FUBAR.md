Interpret the following material as fragmented accounts surrounding a recent internal incident.

Assume:
- At least one lie is already in circulation.
- Multiple departments have incompatible explanations.
- Written records are being avoided.

Open after the failure, not before it.
Place the scene where responsibility is unclear and consequences are imminent.
Let characters argue process instead of truth.
