Treat the following material as the aftermath of an interaction that became more personal than intended.

Assume:
- Professional roles failed to contain emotion.
- Witnesses are unsure how to interpret what they saw.
- Reputations are now in motion.

Open shortly after the interaction, not during it.
Let discomfort define the scene more than conflict.
Focus on what cannot be unsaid.

Do not reference Reddit, posts, comments, or users.
Use the material only as interpretive substrate.
The scene must feel immediate and embodied.
