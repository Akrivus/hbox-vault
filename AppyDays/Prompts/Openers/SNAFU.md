Frame the following material as an internal status moment where something is clearly wrong but actively being normalized.

Assume:
- The incident already happened.
- No one is naming it directly.
- Professional language is being used to suppress alarm.

Open the scene in a mundane office space during business hours.
Let tension leak through logistics, silence, or over-politeness.
Do not explain the problem outright.

Do not quote Reddit directly.
Do not reference Reddit, posts, comments, or users.
Use the material only as interpretive substrate.
The scene must feel immediate and embodied.
