Interpret the following material as technical signals surrounding a system behaving beyond clear human intent.

Assume:
- No single person is in control.
- Documentation exists but does not clarify causality.
- The system’s behavior affects morale, trust, or liability.

Open with observable effects, not explanations.
Let technology feel procedural, not mystical.
Allow uncertainty about whether this is incompetence or emergence.
