Reframe the following material as an HR-mediated interaction attempting to contain emotional fallout.

Assume:
- Someone has already crossed a personal boundary.
- Policy language is flattening a human conflict.
- The emotional cost is asymmetrical.

Open in a space meant for care, feedback, or conflict resolution.
Let institutional language clash with personal stakes.
Avoid clear villains; focus on misalignment.
