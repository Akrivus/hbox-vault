Treat the following material as language recently used by leadership to justify momentum.

Assume:
- Confidence is replacing evidence.
- Emotional conviction is being mistaken for inevitability.
- Doubt exists but is not safe to express directly.

Open during a live address, impromptu gathering, or broadcast message.
Let belief collide with practical concerns in real time.
Do not resolve whether the leader is sincere or manipulative.
