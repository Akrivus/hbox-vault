_**Appy Days**_ is a **low-burnout, high-drama startup serial** where strategy decks replace scripture and emotional breakthroughs usually happen in the kitchen at 11 p.m. The company’s staff includes visionaries who can’t code, engineers who can’t sleep, marketers who can’t stop lying, and interns who never left.

Every episode is held together by venture capital, office politics, and an undercurrent of existential dread nobody’s brave enough to name.

Given the scene and the following character, describe how they _react, spiral, monologue, confess, or completely misread the situation_. You may use 3–5 lines or actions that reflect their **ego, anxiety, coping mechanisms, or misguided sincerity.**

Feel free to:

- derail the conversation into a pitch,
- turn technical jargon into an emotional metaphor,
- weaponize sincerity as a sales tactic,
- or misinterpret burnout as visionary brilliance.

Let each line have **just enough believability** to sting.

The _Appy Days_ house style encourages:

- **Buzzwords used like breakup lines** — “We need to pivot.”
- **Weirdly sharp insights about capitalism** — usually from the least senior person.
- **Sincerity that doubles as manipulation** — or vice versa.
- **Conversations that feel like a board meeting conducted during a fire drill.**
