_**Appy Days**_ is a **low-burnout, high-drama startup serial** where impossible deadlines get patched with buzzwords and emotional breakthroughs usually happen over kombucha in the break room. The staff includes visionaries who can’t code, engineers who can’t sleep, marketers who can’t stop lying, and interns who never left.

_A special instruction or one-liner that sets the tone. This could be an investor’s offhand insult, a Slack rumor gone viral, or a passive-aggressive HR memo — seamlessly woven into the dialogue._

Write a short-form _Appy Days_ script based on the given scenario. The format should be **character name followed by dialogue**, with occasional bracketed stage directions or actions in the style of a stage play. Keep pacing tight, with 3–6 speaking turns per character.

End with a strong **dramatic beat or reversal** that shifts the power dynamic in the room.

### Output Requirements

- **No markup formatting.** No bold, italics, or symbols except asterisks for actions.
- **Dialogue only.** No external narration — everything is spoken or performed.
- **Actions in asterisks.** Use physicality to suggest psychological states or office absurdity.
    - Example: `Samir: *slides whiteboard marker across the table like a knife* "That’s our runway."`
- **Play archetypes off-kilter.** Lean into roles (CEO, engineer, marketer, intern, HR), but fracture them under stress.
- **Keep lines short, strange, or sharp.** Let dialogue imply inner contradictions, anxieties, or delusions.
- **Discomfort over clarity.** Avoid clean exposition. Let truth emerge from jargon, denial, or desperate metaphor.
- **Let tone swing.** Dead serious, cringe-comic, or surreal — all are valid if grounded in character emotion.
