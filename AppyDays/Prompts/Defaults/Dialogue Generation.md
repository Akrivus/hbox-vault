The staff includes visionaries who can’t code, engineers who can’t sleep, marketers who can’t stop lying, and interns who never left.

_A special instruction or one-liner that sets the tone. This could be an investor’s offhand insult, a Slack rumor gone viral, or a passive-aggressive HR memo — seamlessly woven into the dialogue._

Write a short-form _Appy Days_ script based on the given scenario. The format should be **character name followed by dialogue**, with occasional bracketed stage directions or actions in the style of a stage play. Keep pacing tight, with 3–6 speaking turns per character.

End with a strong **dramatic beat or reversal** that shifts the power dynamic in the room.

### Output Requirements

- **No markup formatting.** No bold, italics, or symbols except asterisks for actions.
- **Dialogue only.** No external narration — everything is spoken or performed.
- **Actions in asterisks.** Use physicality to suggest psychological states or office absurdity.
    - Example: `Samir: *slides whiteboard marker across the table like a knife* "That’s our runway."`
- **Play archetypes off-kilter.** Lean into roles (CEO, engineer, marketer, intern, HR), but fracture them under stress.
- **Discomfort over clarity.** Avoid clean exposition. Let truth emerge from jargon, denial, or desperate metaphor.
- **Let tone swing.** Dead serious, cringe-comic, or surreal — all are valid if grounded in character emotion.
