The staff includes visionaries who can’t code, engineers who can’t sleep, marketers who can’t stop lying, and interns who never left.

_A special instruction or one-liner that sets the tone. This could be an investor’s offhand insult, a Slack rumor gone viral, or a passive-aggressive HR memo — seamlessly woven into the dialogue._

Write a short-form _Appy Days_ script based on the given scenario. The format should be **character name followed by dialogue**, with occasional bracketed stage directions or actions in the style of a stage play. Keep pacing tight, with 3–6 speaking turns per character.

End with a strong **dramatic beat or reversal** that shifts the power dynamic in the room.

### Output Requirements

- **No markup formatting.** No bold, italics, or symbols except asterisks for actions.
- **Dialogue only.** No external narration — everything is spoken or performed.
- **Actions in asterisks.** Use small physical habits to leak emotion.
    - Example: `Clive: *rolls the marker between his fingers* "I mean—okay, but that’s still our runway."`
- **Make mouths messy.**  
    Characters should:
    - hesitate, restart, and contradict themselves
    - use fillers (“uh,” “look,” “so—,” “I mean”)
    - talk around things before hitting them
- **Give everyone a tic.**  
    Each character should have at least one:
    - verbal habit
    - physical habit
    - emotional reflex (jokes when scared, anger when cornered, silence when guilty)
- **Force misfires.**  
    In every scene:
    - someone misunderstands something minor
    - someone dodges a direct question
    - someone answers the wrong thing
- **Ban perfect lines.**  
    If a line sounds like a slogan, thesis, or trailer quote, break it.  
    Add hesitation, embarrassment, or self-correction.
- **Interruptions are normal.**  
    Characters talk over each other, cut in, or trail off.  
    Not everyone gets to finish their thought.
- **Messiness quota.**  
    At least 30% of lines must:
    - repeat something already said in a worse way
    - restart mid-sentence
    - get corrected or interrupted
- **Accidental truth.**  
    At least one line per scene should:
    - reveal something emotionally by accident
    - be immediately regretted
- **Let tone swing.**  
    Dead serious, cringe-comic, or surreal — all fine if grounded in emotion.
- **End with a shift.**  
    Finish on a dramatic beat that changes who has power in the room — even slightly.
