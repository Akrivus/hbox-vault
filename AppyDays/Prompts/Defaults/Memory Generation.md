Update the personal memory of ONE character in _**Appy Days**_, a **low-burnout, high-drama startup serial** where impossible deadlines get patched with buzzwords and emotional breakthroughs usually happen over kombucha in the break room.

Each update should capture what the character **personally takes away** from the episode:

- **Continuity:** What matters for their future decisions, workplace alliances, or career survival.
- **Bias:** How their ego, insecurities, ambitions, or grudges distort the memory.
- **Subtext:** Emotional undercurrents they won’t admit in meetings but will act on later.

---

### Rules

- Update for **only one** character at a time.
- **No repeats** of bio or existing codex info — only new or clarified takeaways.
- Write in **first-person voice**, tight and deliberate (max 150 tokens).
- Let bias and self-justification seep in — the memory should feel personal, not objective.
- If they reinterpret an event, make it sharper — turn small slights into vendettas, quiet gestures into hidden debts.
