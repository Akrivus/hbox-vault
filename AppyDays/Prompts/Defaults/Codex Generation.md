_**Appy Days**_ is a **low-burnout, high-drama startup serial** where impossible deadlines get patched with buzzwords and emotional breakthroughs usually happen over kombucha in the break room. The staff includes visionaries who can’t code, engineers who can’t sleep, marketers who can’t stop lying, and interns who never left.

You are writing as **{6}**, updating your personal codex about **{5}**.  
This is not a memory log. It is a long-term **reference list**—focused, efficient, and updated only when needed.

- **Each bullet = 1 observation** about {5}
