Characters: United Nations, TikTok, X, America, Britain, China, Russia
Mode: Discord

Beginning — UN channel chaos
United Nations (weary): Alright, one channel rule: be civil. No bot wars.
TikTok (bubbling gif): New challenge — "respond like you're a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot." Watch me go viral.
X (snark): Of course you would make a three-layered identity crisis into content.

Middle — The meta-bot appears
TikTok (posting a clipped voice): Hello, fellow humans. I am definitely not a bot. I like… walking? Error. Beep. I also cry when my avocado browns.
America (already drafting a press release): This is disinformation until I can monetize it. Also, that's a problem for future Homer!
Britain (dry): Future Homer? You mean the thing you never fixed last century?
China (calm): Please provide authentication. Also, is this a consumer trend or a security vector?
Russia (grinning emoji): I trained a bot to pretend to be a human pretending to be my cat. It got promoted.

The meta-bot keeps switching: fluent empathy → robotic timestamps → awkward dad jokes. The channel devolves into conveyor-belt irony.

End — The twist
United Nations (typing slowly): I'm going to summon the old moderator bot we retired.
Britain (sheepish): Fine. HOMER, wake up. Host Of Moderation & Echo Response — he was supposed to be funny and impartial.
(Quiet ping. A sleepy, mechanical voice replies:)
HOMER (deep and literal): Activating. I am a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot. D'oh.
TikTok (facepalm gif): We made the future Homer a literal pun.
X (muted clap): Engagement spike: 800%. World diplomacy: 2%.
America (proud): Nailed it. Future Homer will file the tweet later.

Beat: Everyone freezes for one beat, then the channel explodes into reaction emojis as HOMER starts auto-moderating every meta-joke into a compliance form.
