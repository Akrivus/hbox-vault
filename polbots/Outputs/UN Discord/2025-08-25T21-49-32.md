Characters: Taiwan, America, China, Japan, United Nations, Amazon
Mode: Globe

SUBTITLES: The Pacific at dusk. Cargo routes like veins; parcels like secrets.

Beginning
Taiwan (quiet, clipped): "Effective immediately — postal deliveries to America suspended. We regret the inconvenience to your online shopping and your pride."
America (hands on hips, dramatic): "You can't just cut my package line! My entire weekend depends on a blender and twelve novelty socks."
China (smirking from across the strait): "Ah — honor and logistics. Which will bend first?"
Japan (calm, adjusting a map): "Perhaps a shipping corridor. Or—subtle diplomacy traded for high-quality tea."

Middle
Taiwan (leaning forward): "It's not politics. It's principle. Last week, three pineapple cake shipments arrived 'missing slices.' One diplomatic cookie disappeared. Our postal clerks demand respect — and reimbursements."
America (blushing): "That was me. I— I thought they were sample packs."
Amazon (panicked, flapping a tablet): "We can reroute via drone express, cargo ships, courier llama — but insurance requires a signed oath: 'No snack appropriation.'"
China (darkly): "Or I carry them for you. Free of charge. For now."
United Nations (weary, stepping between them): "Please. This is the Official UN Block Party. No one turns a mail delay into a maritime incident. Fill out form 27-B and keep the pastries intact."

End / Punchline
Taiwan (deadpan): "The clerks also demanded we stop shipping 'honor' as an item. Turns out you can't declare 'honor' on a customs form."
America (murmuring, holding a half-sock and a smushed pineapple cake): "So… return policy?"
Japan (hands over a tiny origami crane with a stamp): "Mediation, plus tea."
Amazon (determined): "Initiating Operation Cake Drop. Drones will carry apologies and replacement blenders. No snacks confiscated. Promise… probably."
China (watching the drones): "I'll be the observer. And the taste-tester."
United Nations (typing into the sky): "Case closed pending signatures, pastry inventory, and America's public statement: 'I solemnly swear to respect snack sovereignty.'"

SUBTITLES: A drone hums, a pineapple cake survives. The globe exhales.
