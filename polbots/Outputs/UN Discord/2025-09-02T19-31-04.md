United Nations (admin): Alright, BRICS-official-rebrand-pitch voice — try to keep it to three slides and zero global incidents, please.

Russia (sharing screen): Slide one: "BRICS 2.0 — Unified Strength, Modern Future." Look — bold colors. Mascot idea: a bear with a blazer.

Ukraine (pings with breaking link): Uh, small thing — live demo of an autonomous drone swarm. You might want to, uh, watch the background of your slide.

Russia: What background? It’s a GIF. I— mute that video, someone—

China (calmly): We could pivot. Tech-forward. "BRICSwave." Drones as a symbol of coordination. Very on-message.

India: Add "BRICSapp" — one log-in, one chat. Also, less bears; more peacocks. More neutral.

Brazil: Carnival launch event. We throw confetti drones. Everyone dances. Logo as glitter.

South Africa: Make it about development, not mascots. Focus on infrastructure, education. Also, please don’t burn the conference center with your confetti, Brazil.

America (typing with a grin): Did anyone try "NATO Premium"? Because the ad buys are killer.

United Nations: Please stop trolling. Russia, control your slides.

Russia (panicking): It’s not my slides! The drones are… weaving through the screen. They're carrying tiny flags—

Ukraine (proudly): —Demo only. See? Autonomous, resilient, swarm tactics. For collective security research? Totally hypothetical.

China (eyes lighting up): Trademark "BRICSwarm." Offer enterprise packages. Monetize peacekeeping.

India: Freemium peace model. Basic: diplomacy. Premium: geopolitical analytics.

Brazil: Freemium should include samba filters.

South Africa: No filters. Real policy. Real money for schools.

Russia (glaring): Those tiny drones are dropping something on my slide. Is that… my bear with a party hat?

Ukraine: Oh, that was the "friendly rebrand overlay." You seemed too serious. We thought you'd like hats.

United Nations (frantically): Okay, meeting wrap. Vote in thirty seconds. No more live demonstrations.

America (drops laughing emoji and a link): Trending already. #BRICSwave — sponsored by ads.

Final beat — notification sound: dozens of drone emojis flood the channel. A bot auto-generates a press release: "BRICSwarm: Because unity is better when it trends." The poll shows one thumbs-up from Brazil, three confused claps, and a single angry emoji from Russia.

Russia (DM to United Nations): I resign as presenter.

Ukraine (typing calmly): Branding consultancy — invoices incoming. Subscription: $9.99/month for geopolitical disruption, includes confetti.

United Nations (exasperated): The meeting failed, the logo went viral, and Russia is literally trending under 'party bear.' At least — nobody asked America for input.

America (last message): You're welcome.
