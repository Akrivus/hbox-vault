United Nations (admin): *#ops-chat muted, deep sigh* — Heads up: America just dropped a public notice about a strike on a Caribbean vessel. Reported target: Tren de Aragua. Casualty count: 11. Keep it civil.

Venezuela: You hit our people in our waters. This is—this is outright aggression. Who authorized this?

America (voice chat, half-asleep, coffee in one hand): We interdicted a gang-run arms-and-narcotics transit; bad actors neutralized. Mission success. Next slide, please.

Britain (pings, 800ms typing, in ALLCAPS and bullet points): GENERAL—uh—AMERICA—listen, premium think-tank energy now: this is a high-consequence nodal interdiction in the littoral space enabling cascade denial of Tren de Aragua’s sea-based logistics. Immediately recommend: 1) forward-deploy SIGINT drones, 2) legal pre-brief on maritime interdiction doctrine (UNCLOS adjunct), 3) a calibrated comms campaign to shape regional narrative—think: pop-up PSAs + influencer-level messaging—sorry, that was caffeinated. Also, ops matrix attached (17 slides). TRUST ME. THIS SCALES.

Panama: The vessel was in international waters off our coast. We inspect fishing licenses. Also, who brought up influencers? My port has Wi-Fi.

Colombia (uploads grainy video): We tracked the same boat. At 01:12 they're passing crates that definitely looked like—empanadas? Wait. Zooming—no, that's definitely not empanadas. Or maybe—

Venezuela: You call them "bad actors" and they call themselves citizens. You don't get to decloak sovereignty with a drone and a tweet.

United Nations (admin): Cool it. Escalation thread spun up. Moderation preference: de-escalate or I lock the channel and everyone loses perms.

Britain (pumps out an attached 17-slide deck with a flourish, then three seconds later): ALSO—pro-tip—phased escalation, persona-mapped PSYOPS, and a press-ready soundbite: "We acted to protect maritime security." You're welcome.

Panama (reply): You sent this to the "Community Potluck" channel by mistake. Slide 7 is titled "Appetizers & Policy." Also your slide GIF is a jittery squirrel with a tiny tie.

America (takes a bite of burger, glances at GIF): I like the squirrel. Proceed.

Venezuela: This is absurd and illegal—

United Nations (admin): Channel locked for 10 minutes. Britain, stop emailing GIFs to potlucks. America, maybe read the legal memo before the photo op.

Britain (last message, still hyped): If we can align legal, kinetic, narrative, and snack logistics—sorry, snack logistics?

Punchline/Twist: Britain excitedly DMs the General a "comprehensive, caffeinated plan" — and the file is literally the holiday party spreadsheet with a column labeled "Who brings empanadas?" America replies in DM: "Bring empanadas. Also: very good brief."
