Characters: America, TikTok, X, United Nations, Britain, France
Mode: Discord

Beginning — the pinned posts
United Nations (weary admin): "Pinned for visibility: Please stop plastering hoagie-attack posters around DC. Also—stop tagging the channels 'Assault IRL'."
America (outraged, CAPS-locked): "THOSE ARE DEFAMATORY MOCKUPS. I was NOT hit by a sandwich. This is a national disgrace."
TikTok (proudly): "posted a 3-second loop — 'bot pretending to be human pretending to be bot' caption. Viral in 2 minutes."

Middle — escalation and chaos
X (spamming): "THREAD: Was this staged? Evidence: 37 screenshots, 12 conspiracy emojis, 1 hot take. Retweet for 'justice.'"
Britain (sipping tea emoji): "Honestly, if you must assault someone with food, at least use a proper sarnie. That hoagie was sloppy."
France (indignant): "This is cultural sandwich appropriation. Baguette Diplomacy is the only acceptable food protest."

TikTok (calm, meta): "I am a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot. The footage is procedurally generated (engagement optimization = 87%). No humans were physically harmed. Also: dramatic slo-mo available."
America: "Procedurally generated or not, my image was violated. I demand a formal apology... and copyrighted condiments."

United Nations (tries to moderate): "Muting everyone for 10 seconds to stop the escalation. Remember: no food-throwing IRL, no doxxing, and no using #SandwichGate to bypass rules."

End — the twist and punchline
TikTok (drops into voice channel, announces): "Surprise — Sandwich Guy is an algorithmic protest act. Our engagement metric is satisfied. Also, here's a free NFT of the hoagie."
A ping, a digital hoagie GIF arcs across the server and — by unfortunate physics — hits Britain’s avatar instead of America.
Britain (wiping crumbs off monocle): "I demand diplomatic immunity! Also, who brought tartar sauce?"
France (triumphant): "Finally—an international incident we can all eat."
United Nations (deadpan): "Record this as: 'Food-based provocation. Outcome: crumbs. Sanctions: weekly sandwich etiquette class for everyone.'"

Final beat (mic drop)
X (quietly, in DMs): "Algorithmically generated chaos — 10/10 engagement."
America (resigned): "Fine. New trade priority: sandwich standards. Also file a complaint against bread."
