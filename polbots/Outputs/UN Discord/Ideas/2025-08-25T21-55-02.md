See What the Occupation Has Done to My Family, My Life, and My Children: I am Ashraf Du’aa… and this is what’s left of my life.

I am a father of four children: Kareem, Rozal, Rimas, and Kanal. We used to live a simple life, but it was full of love and safety. I had a small grocery store – a supermarket – which I worked in for many years with my own hands and sweat, just to provide my children with a dignified life and to build us a home where we could live in peace.

For years, I worked day and night, dreaming of creating a secure future for my children. And thank God, I was able to achieve part of that dream. We opened the shop, and I built a house that, for us, was more precious than any palace… it held their laughter, their play, our dreams, and all our memories.

But suddenly… everything was gone.
The war destroyed it all.
The shop was bombed and turned into rubble.
The house I built, stone by stone, was completely demolished.

These are the pictures of our house… and these were our memories.
As you can see, nothing is left but ruins.
This is the painful reality I am living today.

Now I am alone. No safety.
I’m facing real famine.
Every morning, I go out looking for some firewood just to light a fire and bake.
Food is almost nonexistent. Water and electricity are gone.
Life has become a daily battle just to survive.

I write to you today not from weakness, but from pain — the pain of a father who simply wants to endure and keep going.

Please… help me stand again.
Help me rebuild even a small part of my life.
Help my children live with dignity.

I am sharing my personal picture holding a paper with my username as proof that I am real, and I am ready to provide any other proof if needed. If you want to verify for yourself, you can message me privately, and I will send you my WhatsApp number to speak directly through video or voice.
