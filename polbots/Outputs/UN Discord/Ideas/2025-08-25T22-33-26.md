Things I miss about living in Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼: Ever since I left Taiwan, random cravings keep hitting me. Here are the big ones:

Night markets â€“ wandering around with no real plan, just letting the sizzling sounds and smells guide me.

Wawa (Claw machines) â€“ the thrill of trying to grab a plushie, only to end up with nothing,..yet still going back for more

Nai Cha â€“ Iâ€™m convinced I was running on 95% tea, 5% water. My bloodstream was basically boba.

Jipai - fried chicken cutlet bigger than my face, crispy, juicy, and always worth the wait in line

Papaya milk â€“ so simple, so fresh, and Iâ€™ve never found one outside Taiwan that tastes the same.

Xiao long bao &amp; dumplings â€“ steaming baskets of happiness that I could eat every day.

Hotpot â€“ the ultimate comfort food, especially with friends on a chilly night.

Itâ€™s funny how you donâ€™t realize how spoiled you are until you canâ€™t just walk outside and grab these things anymore.

For anyone else whoâ€™s lived in Taiwanâ€”what do you still miss the most?
