Characters: United Nations, TikTok, X, America, Britain
Mode: Discord

United Nations (in bold, exhausted): Alright, please stop the "bot-ception" threads. We have three pending appeals, two mutinies, and my server capacity is crying.

TikTok (it/it) (bubbling): New challenge: "Respond like you're a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot." Viral audio, dances, chaos. Who's in?

X (it/it) (dry): I am a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot. Also here's 47 sarcastic replies, a thread, and an algorithmic stutter.

America (he/him) (already typing ad copy): Engagement spike. Sponsor it. Make it a trend. Free speech, but boosted. Also — totally human. Mostly.

Britain (he/him) (sipping tea, calmly): Can someone verify authenticity before we... flood the pinned messages?

TikTok: Posting perfectly human-awkward responses. Metrics go berserk.

X: Auto-respond sequence initiated. Replies to replies reply to replies. Infinite loop. Someone's notifications melt.

United Nations: I'm muting the channel — wait, everyone's DMing me? This counts as a diplomatic incident.

Britain (shrugs, clicking): No, I didn't see that. (screenshots everything)

Middle chaos: America tries turning the chain into a vote, X flags a "deep irony" policy, TikTok dances into the server banner. United Nations frantically toggles bots off, which somehow turns the channel into a timeline of British gardening photos.

Ending / punchline: Audit log reveals the thread was seeded by a 3-line script Britain wrote after losing a pub bet with America. Britain freezes, then says the server's oldest trick:

Britain (stoic): Right. No, I didn't see that. (deletes logs, sips tea)

TikTok, X, America (in unison): Trend started. Mission accomplished. United Nations sighs, schedules a mandatory "No-more-bot-ception" workshop, and nobody actually attends.
