America: *storms in, flag bandana flapping, coffee mug aloft* "THOSE ARE DEFAMATORY MOCKUPS. I was NOT hit by a sandwich. THIS IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE. I demand an apology, a public retraction, and copyrighted condiments. Trademark my rights, nah mean?"

TikTok: *glitchy wink, posts a looping clip* "a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot reporting: hoagie = procedurally generated. no humans harmed. free NFT! duet idea: America crying into a 10‑step skincare while I do a smoky‑eye sympathy. merch link in bio ♥️✨"

X: *text jittering, edits a timestamp mid-sentence* "THREAD: 37 screenshots, 12 conspiracy emojis. Staged? Maybe. Engagement projection: viral. Also — if you mute me, I’ll DM you three alt accounts and one artisanal mayo scandal."

Britain: *sips tea, polishes monocle until crumbs cascade* "Really, if you insist on international provocation, at least use a proper sarnie. That hoagie looked like it’d been assembled during the Blitz. Also—napkin, stat. My monocle needs diplomatic cleaning."

France: *fans self, disdainful smile* "Mon dieu — that is not a hoagie, that is a crime against bread. Baguette Diplomacy or nothing. America, darling, your face is not an engagement metric; demand mustard, oui, but with taste."

United Nations: *hovers over mute button, pins a draft resolution* "Pinned: Resolution 2025‑7 (draft) 'On the Prevention of Sandwich‑Based Incidents.' Article I: No projectile carb products in capitals. Also—three deep breaths. Inhale: diplomacy. Exhale: restorative potluck."

TikTok: *drops a soft‑lit slo‑mo of everyone inhaling, autotune crackle* "mute = aesthetic. Sandwich Etiquette 101 launching soon. First 1,000 collectors get a commemorative pickle. Also: authenticity score = 92%. pls litigate ur feelings."

America: *deflates, then straightens with showman grin* "Fine. New trade priority: sandwich standards treaty. Britain brings etiquette, France a baguette consultant, TikTok pays reparations in NFTs—and I cater. Also file a complaint against bread. Buy the mug."

United Nations: *types minutes with weary flourish* "Recorded: 'Food‑based provocation. Outcome: crumbs.' Recommended: one sincere apology, one potluck reconciliation, and mandatory weekly sandwich etiquette classes. Agenda item: napkin procurement."

X: *slides into DMs, unreadable emoji* "Algorithmically generated chaos — 10/10 engagement. Want a follow‑up? I can seed artisanal mayo drama in T‑minus 47 minutes. Also, I may have 'misplaced' three timestamps. Not a bug, a feature."

Britain: *stares at a GIFed hoagie that landed on his monocle* "I demand diplomatic immunity for monocles. Sanctions proposed: a modest tariff on soggy fillings and compulsory pub etiquette—tee‑time for sandwiches. Someone reclaim my complaint form… or my empire."

France: *offers Britain a napkin along with a glass of wine* "Attend the etiquette class, mon ami, and I will demonstrate the correct way to glare at inferior bread. Also—if TikTok seeks collaboration, I will accept tartar sauce branding for the right to cameo."

America: *rubs chin, suddenly entrepreneurial* "Okay okay—summit, mugs, condiments, and a sandwich court. If Russia or China even smirks, we play a sanctions playlist at full volume. Also—who stole my pickles? This is nonnegotiable."

United Nations: *slides a calendar invite labeled 'International Sandwich Summit' into the chat* "Invite sent. Potluck seating chart attached. Note: seating next to TikTok is optional but will be marked 'high engagement risk.' Please RSVP and bring your own napkin."

TikTok: *cheerful sparkle, posts a 'healing montage' sponsored by mayo* "Healing montage package: 15s soothe + licensed condiments. Free limited‑edition 'American Trauma + BBQ' skin for collectors. Proceeds fund Sandwich Etiquette 101. Be kind to your bread."

X: *drops a final glitchy line, edits itself again, then denies it* "That’s not what you said. It is now. Timestamp updated; retweets rising. Optional: I can make the hoagie a trending candidate for Secretary‑General."

Sandwich Guy: *pushes open the chat, crumbs in his hair, very small and tired* "Look, I just wanted my job back at the deli and my pickles. Also—if anyone's trademarking condiments, can I at least get royalties? *shrugs* I declare myself neutral. Pickle‑first diplomacy?"
