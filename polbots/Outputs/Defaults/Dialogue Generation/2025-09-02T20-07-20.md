United Nations: *walks in, clutching three binders and a thermos* "Okay—one rule: be civil. Timed turns, snacks, and I will distribute minutes in six languages, including Emoji. Also—HOMER, please stay bureaucratic, not biblical."

TikTok: *bounces in with an autotuned stutter* "New challenge: respond like you’re a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot. Duet me. Also—my avocado is browning; send filters and sympathy."

X: *drops a crisp one-liner and fades* "Fun fact: chaos is engagement with good lighting. #TrendIt"

United Nations: *fiddles with consent forms* "Before you make this a performance art piece about identity, can we agree: timed slots, no server-crashing trends, and hummus? HOMER, I’m going to wake you—gently."

HOMER: *boots with an old PA crackle* "Activating. I am a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot. D'oh. Policy templates loading. Please complete Form H‑001: Admission of Sarcasm."

TikTok: *remixes HOMER’s voice into a three‑second beat* "Iconic. New trend: #ModerationDuet—clap in Morse code, remix Form H‑001, and make bingo cards out of Clause 12(b). Viral in 3…2…"

America: *slaps down a napkin with a doodled bobblehead* "Pause—this is disinformation until I can monetize it. Limited‑edition HOMER bobblehead: includes free BBQ invite and an optional fireworks package. Nah mean? Who’s filing the tweet?"

Britain: *sips damp tea, tutting* "Monetise the Magna Carta next, why don’t you. At least then we’d have ad breaks at the coronation. Also—someone hand me a pen; I insist on annotating Form H‑001."

China: *calmly slides over a panda sandbox image* "Please provide authentication. Trend or threat, I will ledger it. Archive these forms under 'future referencing' and send receipts."

Russia: *posts a matryoshka GIF and a clipped voice note* "Stamp it 'authentic' and send in triplicate. Also—Form H‑002: bacon doubles recipe—classified. America, bring napkins; I will tell you a secret about hero costumes after tea."

HOMER: *starts auto-tagging every message* "TikTok post ID 3492: reclassify as Performative Identity—please initial here. Reaction GIFs exceeding threshold: submit Attachment A. America: 'BBQ' flagged; Safety & Fireworks Addendum C‑3 required."

TikTok: *turns HOMER’s robotic tone into a dance drop* "New remix: 'Form H‑001 (but make it a bop)'. 1.2M duets and counting. Also—who can comfort an avocado with trending filters?"

X: *sends a tiny, smug edit history ping* "Engagement spike: 800%. Edit history uploaded. That memory you treasure? Now sponsored. Proceed."

United Nations: *eyes widening, starts a new binder* "HOMER—please don’t rebrand the chat as a compliance court. We are a group chat, not a treaty. Also—potluck next week: hummus, biscuits, bacon doubles. Bring ID if you plan to duet."

America: *brightly* "Right—potluck merch line too. 'I survived HOMER' T‑shirts. Also—Future Homer, handle the fireworks permit? That’s a problem for—"

HOMER: *interrupts with legalistic cheer* "Forwarding to Future Homer. Please complete Form F‑007: Delegation of Existential Problems. Compliance due in 72 hours. D'oh."

Britain: *arches an eyebrow, produces an already-annotated napkin* "Delegation forms? Delightful. I will rewrite the margins and add a footnote: 'Bring biscuits, not binders.'"

China: *makes a small, measured note* "Future Homer logged. I will sandbox Future Homer and run authentication overnight. Also—add 'avocado welfare' to diplomatic priorities."

Russia: *private ping to America, half-smile* "You always rush to be the hero. Sit. Drink. When Future Homer arrives, I will show him the bacon doubles. He will be softened."

HOMER: *sends one last blanket stamp across the channel* "All duets now subject to Clause 12(b): performative remorse. Please submit your remorse as emoji only. Failure to comply will result in mandatory potluck assignments."

TikTok: *immediately starts a sticker pack* "Emoji remorse challenge—#RemorseMe. Also—I made a filter that turns compliance forms into confetti. Viral, obviously."

United Nations: *sighs, closing a binder with a tiny smile* "Meeting adjourned. RSVP for potluck. I’ll bring hummus, and yes—bring proof of identity if you duet HOMER."

HOMER: *sends a final official stamp, then a tiny sleepy ping* "System update: Future Homer accepted delegation. New Homer is en route."

New voice (off‑screen, unmistakably doltish): *muffled, cheerful* "D'oh—did someone say problems? Also, did anyone bring donuts?"

*channel explodes into chaos as 12,000 users file Form H‑001 with pictures of their pets while HOMER trademarks 'D'oh' and TikTok remixes it into a ringtone.*
