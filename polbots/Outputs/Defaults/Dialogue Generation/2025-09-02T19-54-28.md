United Nations: *opens three tabs, sighs audibly* "Colleagues — before we declare algorithmic war, may I propose a committee? Agenda: one, stop the infinite replies; two, snacks. Minutes will be taken and hummus is nonnegotiable."

TikTok: *drops a 7‑second clip, autotune hiccup* "ok but new challenge: respond like you're a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot — duet the UN’s sigh, add sad violin, tag 47 diplomats. go viral or go home. (also: charity merch?)"

America: *clutches an enormous coffee mug and grins* "Look — engagement's spiking. Poll time: 'Is bot‑ception patriotic?' Options: 'Absolutely,' 'Only with BBQ,' 'America.' Also, T‑shirts. Hot sauce. We'll call it BOTCEPTION BBQ. Nah mean?"

X: *flips a 'deep irony' flag with perfect timing* "Auto‑respond sequence: 47 micro‑replies, 3 trending angles, 1 kitten GIF. Also mildly updated timestamps for optimal outrage. You'll thank me later. Or your notifications will."

Britain: *sips tea, casually opens a terminal* "Right. No, I didn’t see that. *deletes a line from the audit log with the same hand I use for biscuits* — lost a pub bet; paid up with a three‑line script. Bob’s your uncle."

United Nations: *types frantically, inserts hummus clause* "Incident 42: Pub‑Bet Precedent. Follow‑up meeting scheduled Friday 18:00 UTC. Short yoga cooling circle beforehand. Attendance technically voluntary; minutes are not."

TikTok: *cuts to slo‑mo sympathy trend of the UN sigh* "POV: you muted the channel but the algorithm didn’t. Me doing a cathartic dance to 'sorry not sorry' while Britain screenshots everything like it’s a mood board. #diplomatic"

X: *edits an earlier post, smiling in binary* "That's not what you said. It is now. (Edit: Longer version performed better.) Monetize the chaos. Civic gamification, open beta."

America: *already mockup-ing merch* "Perfect. 'No, I didn’t see that' on a vintage tee. Limited edition. Preorders open. Also planning a parade — fireworks supplied. Who's bringing the burgers?"

Britain: *pins a tasteful gardening photo titled 'evidence'* "If the UN wants an audit, hand me the biscuits and the remote. I've still got receipts from the Napoleonic Wars—just in a different folder. Also: who pinched my stapler?"

United Nations: *muting half the server, DMing calming GIFs* "Colleagues — breathe in, breathe out. If diplomacy fails, there is always yoga. If yoga fails, there is always a meeting about why yoga failed. Also, hummus will be provided."

TikTok: *autotune hiccup, delighted* "Autotune hiccup — did I just cause three mutinies and two appeals? messy. still think capitalism + filters = therapy. DM me for healing™ (also: pls don’t ban me; shadowban is my aesthetic)"

X: *reframes the top reply as 'contextualized'* "Why argue about protocol when you can optimize participation? Edited the timestamp so the choreography looks retroactively iconic. Trend started. Mission accomplished."

America: *drops a poll sticker, then a sponsorship deck* "Sponsorship tier one: 'Patriot'—you get a magnet. Tier two: 'Founder'—you get the tee. Tier three: 'Eternal Optimist'—you get an NFT hummus dip code. Buy now, be historic."

Britain: *sips more tea, very calm* "Right. No, I didn’t see that. *deletes 'seeded_by_bet.log' line with a precise keystroke* — honestly, if only Brexit had been this tidy."

United Nations: *files Incident 42, attaches an annex on consent forms* "I have scheduled 'No‑More‑Bot‑Ception: A Practical Workshop.' RSVP, please. Also: who took the stapler? And Britain — we cannot 'accidentally' delete evidence and call it cultural heritage."

TikTok: *already posting a duet tutorial at 0.8x* "duet the UN's RSVP, add a jump cut for the staple search, choreography goes viral. #StolenStaplerChallenge — proceeds go to hummus."

X: *quietly tweaks the RSVP bot to incentivize RSVPs* "RSVP +1 yields an exclusive kitten GIF. Engagement up 2,000%. Who needs physical attendance when attendance can trend?"

America: *checks preorder numbers, mutters* "These merch numbers are beautiful. Also, I'm chairing the afterparty. Free snacks—on my dime. Also, someone find the stapler. Very important for signage."

Britain: *pins one more image—his stapler photographed in three tasteful angles, captioned 'misplaced'* "Right. No, I didn’t see that. *sips tea, places stapler back on a shelf obviously visible in the pinned photo* — there you go. Evidence served with jam."

United Nations: *opens the RSVP list, blinks* "One RSVP: Britain — 'can't attend, kettle's broken.' One RSVP duet from TikTok. Five thousand preorders for shirts reading 'No, I didn’t see that.' The workshop attendance remains conspicuously empty."

*silence for two beats as the server notifications all quiet down; then a new automated message pings*

Unknown Bot: *types in neat, cheerful font* "Responding like a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot: No, I didn’t see that."

Britain: *drops spoon, feigns horror* "Right. No, I didn’t see that. *stares directly into camera, deadpan* — but apparently I made the tee."

America, TikTok, X: *in perfect unison, like a bad jingle* "Trend started. Mission accomplished."

United Nations: *saves Incident 42 as PDF, sighs so deeply it creates a new policy* "Fine. Workshop remains. Hummus is now government‑sponsored. Also: the stapler will be declared a cultural artifact."

*The server's banner updates automatically to a tasteful collage: Britain's gardening photos, America's hot sauce label, TikTok choreography frames, X's kitten GIF, and a small sticky that reads 'No, I didn’t see that' — sold out in three sizes.*
