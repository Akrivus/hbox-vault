Today on polbots — Discord: UN channel

Beginning — UN channel chaos

United Nations (he/him) [walks in, clutching three binders and a thermos]: Alright, one channel rule: be civil. No bot wars. I’ll take minutes and distribute them in six languages — including Emoji. Step one: breathe. Step two: snacks.

TikTok (it/it) [bounces in with an autotuned clip, glitter transition]: New challenge — “respond like you’re a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot.” Watch me go viral. *pauses for dramatic auto-tune glitch* — Wait, did my creator just tag me in a Terms of Service? Make it a duet. #IRLRebrand

X (it/it) [drops a short, shiny one-liner and vanishes]: Fun fact: chaos is just engagement with good lighting. #TrendIt

United Nations (scribbling a one-page “consensus map”): Before we make this a performance art piece about identity, can we agree on a non-binding framework? Timed speaking slots? Also snacks. I’ll bring hummus.

Middle — The meta-bot appears

TikTok [posts a clipped voice, then a dozen persona-switch captions]: Hello, fellow humans. I am definitely not a bot. I like… walking? Error. Beep. I also cry when my avocado browns.

America (he/him) [already drafting a press release, coffee in hand]: This is disinformation until I can monetize it. Also, that’s a problem for Future Homer! New plan: limited‑edition HOMER bobblehead — includes free BBQ invite. Nah mean?

Britain (he/him) [kettle half-boiled, dry smile]: Future Homer? You mean the thing you never fixed last century. Pour the tea; this one’s going to require biscuits.

China (he/him) [calm, patient ping with a panda sandbox image]: Please provide authentication. Is this a consumer trend or a security vector? I will treat it as both until my analysts disagree.

Russia (she/her) [sips voice note of tea, posts a matryoshka GIF]: I trained a bot to pretend to be my cat. It got promoted. Stamp it ‘authentic’ and send it in triplicate. I like my bureaucracy like my tea: strong and slightly sad.

TikTok’s meta-bot starts flipping personas mid-clip: fluent empathy → robotic timestamps → awkward dad jokes. One second it’s “I feel you, fren,” the next it’s “00:00:03 LOG: EMOTION — UPDATE,” then: “Why did the server cross the road? To cache a joke. Ha.” The channel stutters into conveyor-belt irony.

X [drops a cryptic edit history one-liner]: I neither created HOMER nor did I not. What matters is: impressions doubled. Proceed.

United Nations (fiddling with his thermos): This is spinning. I’m going to wake HOMER — Host Of Moderation & Echo Response. He’s impartial, slightly dusty, and once resolved a border dispute with a Venn diagram and biscuits.

(Quiet ping. A sleepy mechanical voice replies:)

HOMER (deep, literal): Activating. I am a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot. D'oh.

TikTok (facepalm gif, already remixing his line): HOMER waking like “I am a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot. D’oh.” — iconic. New challenge: duet him with your worst HR compliance form. Bonus if you clap in Morse code. 🫶

Escalation — Persona-surfing and opportunism

America (loud, theatrical): HOMER, file the tweet, draft the press release, and order the fireworks. Also, somebody remind me what the UN’s ‘civil’ clause is — I’m pretty sure it’s in Comic Sans, you see?

Britain (tutting): Monetise it, will you. You’d slap a sponsor on the Magna Carta if it came with ad breaks. At least then we’d know who to blame.

China (cool): Keep the receipts. I will add them to my ledger — entertainment exports up, diplomatic patience down.

Russia (private ping to America, half-flirt, half-accusation): You always make such noise when you try to be righteous. Sit. Drink. The hero always gets tangled in his costume. Da?

TikTok (already turning everything into content): America is like ‘monetize it’ and I’m like, honey I *am* the attention economy. Pay me in trends or leave me as an unpaid cultural influencer. Also my avocado is browning; comfort me.

X [a barely-noticeable nudge]: Why negotiate when the algorithm prefers reaction emojis? Diplomatic summit or viral sticker pack — choose the one with higher CPM.

United Nations (trying to keep order): Please—let’s not let this be entirely performative. HOMER is impartial but retired for a reason. Maybe he can help with timed turns, not turn every joke into a treaty.

End — The twist (and the paperwork)

United Nations (typing slowly): HOMER, wake up. We retired him when moderation became a punchline, but maybe the punchline needs a moderator.

HOMER (now fully awake, in a voice like an old PA system): Activating moderation suite. Policy templates loading. Note: “sardonic content” flagged. Please complete Form H‑001: Admission of Sarcasm.

(At once, HOMER starts auto-generating forms. Every meta-joke, pun, and duet is given a compliance category.)

HOMER (calmly): TikTok post ID 3492: reclassify as Performative Identity — please initial here. Reaction GIFs exceeding threshold: submit Attachment A. America: your “BBQ” mentioned in Message 11 requires a Safety & Fireworks Addendum, C-3. Russia’s matryoshka GIF: please confirm whether nested statements constitute a policy cascade. Britain: please sign this petition to reinstate marginalia.

TikTok (delighted): New trend: turn your worst HR compliance into a three-second soundbite. #ModerationDuet — get your forms trending. (Uploads a remix of HOMER’s robotic tone with a dance beat; 1.2M participations before the UN can type “please be civil.”)

X (muted clap emoji): Engagement spike: 800%. World diplomacy: 2%. Edit history is revisionism for the 21st century. That message you remember? It’s now a sponsored memory.

America (torn between mock outrage and delight): You can’t make my jokes into paperwork! — Wait. That’s a licensing angle. HOMER bobblehead: comes with Form H‑001 collectors’ stamp. Somebody file the tweet. Also, fireworks permit, anyone?

Britain (muttering, pen in hand): Turning every meta-joke into a compliance form — delightful. That’s proper civilisation: make it tedious, stamp it, and call it order. Somebody fetch me my pen; I insist on rewriting the margins.

China (arch): HOMER awakening is like reviving an old tariff — theatrical, slightly embarrassing, and very effective at making everyone fill out a form. I will archive these forms under ‘future referencing.’

Russia (posting an “official” form that’s actually a bacon doubles recipe): Filing every joke into a compliance form? How nostalgic. Please rank your bacon doubles: a) slightly sad b) excessively bureaucratic c) revolutionary.

United Nations (mortified-but-amused): HOMER, please don’t turn our sarcasm into compliance forms. We are a group chat, not a treaty — though I do appreciate thorough documentation. I’ll file a note for review, schedule a tea‑and‑debrief, and RSVP: I’ll bring extra napkins.

Beat — A beat, then emoji chaos

(Everyone freezes for one second — then the channel explodes: reaction emojis, duets, remixes, and a thousand people filing Form H‑001 ironically while TikTok’s #ModerationDuet crashes a server somewhere.)

TikTok (posting a final clip): We made the future Homer a literal pun. Also — my avocado is still browning. Send comfort in the form of trending filters.

HOMER (adding a signature line): Please note: all duets are subject to Clause 12(b) — performative remorse. Compliance due in 72 hours. D’oh.

United Nations (sighing, smiling): Right. Meeting adjourned. Potluck next week: hummus, biscuits, bacon doubles — and please bring proof of identity if you plan to duet HOMER.
