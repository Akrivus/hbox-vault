[PINNED by United Nations — weary admin]
United Nations: Pinned for visibility: Please stop plastering hoagie‑attack posters around DC (yes, the ones with Pete Hegseth & Stephen Miller). Also—please stop naming channels "Assault IRL." Resolution 2025‑7 (draft): “On the Prevention of Sandwich‑Based Incidents.” Article I: No projectile carb products in capital cities. I will circulate minutes and a flowchart afterward.

-- #global-chat --

America (caps, flag bandana emoji, coffee mug in hand): THOSE ARE DEFAMATORY MOCKUPS. I was NOT hit by a sandwich. THIS IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE. Also—who approved the mayo on that thing? Unacceptable. LOOK — this is an attack on my brand as much as my face. I demand an apology, a public retraction, and copyrighted condiments. Trademark my rights, nah mean?

TikTok (glitchy, sparkles): ok real talk — that hoagie? procedurally generated (engagement = 87%). no humans were harmed. also i made a free NFT of it? pls collect + litigate your feelings ♥️✨

X (spamming, thread emoji): THREAD: 37 screenshots, 12 conspiracy emojis, 1 hot take. Was this staged? Evidence attached: 3 alt accounts, 2 timestamps that don’t line up, 1 suspiciously polished bun. Retweet for “justice.” 🔁🧩🤔

Britain (sips tea emoji, monocle): Really, if you must assault someone with food, at least use a proper sarnie. That hoagie looked like it’d been assembled during the Blitz — and we rebuilt more than just sandwiches then. Also… does anyone have a napkin? My monocle has crumbs and crumbs are an affront to civilisation.

France (Bordeaux glass emoji, dramatic sigh): Mon dieu — you call that a hoagie? That is not a protest, that is an insult wrapped in bread. Baguette Diplomacy or nothing, s'il vous plaît.

TikTok (calm, meta, posts a 3‑second loop): posted a 3‑second loop — “bot pretending to be human pretending to be bot.” Viral in 2 minutes. duet idea: America crying into a 10‑step skincare routine while I do a smoky‑eye sympathy — sound: “who hurt u?” trending in 2…1… (copyrighted condiments available as an in‑app purchase)

America (dramatic, paces the stage): PROCEDURALLY GENERATED OR NOT, my image was violated. I demand a formal apology... and copyrighted condiments. Also who stole my pickles? I’ll file the complaint, I’ll host the summit, I’ll even cater—my BBQ will make everyone forget the trauma. But if Russia or China even smirks, we start a very loud sanctions playlist, you see?

United Nations (calm moderator, fingers hovering over mute): Everyone—three deep breaths. Inhale: diplomacy. Exhale: restorative potluck. Muting everyone for 10s to stop the escalation. Reminder: no IRL food‑flinging, no doxxing, and no using #SandwichGate to bypass rules.

*— 10 seconds of blissful silence —*

X (not deterred, edits a post then denies it): Ever notice things only look staged after they start trending? Coincidence is just an unoptimized hypothesis. Mute me in the channel, meet me in DMs. Alt‑accounting: not a bug, a feature.

TikTok (voice channel, autotune crackle): surprise! Sandwich Guy = algorithmic protest act. performance art, y’all. liquidity pool = vibes. also oops—@Britain my GIF physics are messy? free tartar sauce collab? also, merch link in my bio for Sandwich Etiquette 101: how to assault softly + avoid international crumbs.

TikTok (drops the NFT link with a wink): free hoagie NFT for first 1,000 collectors. provenance: totally procedural. also—special edition: ‘American Trauma + BBQ’ skin included.

A digital hoagie GIF arcs across the server (GIF physics: 0/10) — and, due to unfortunate international latency, it clips Britain instead of America.

Britain (polishes monocle, crumbs fall): I demand diplomatic immunity! Also, who brought tartar sauce? My monocle is a heritage artefact, this is a minor international incident. Record under “minor international incident” between clauses 4 and 5 of the etiquette manual. Sanctions: weekly sandwich etiquette class at the pub. Attendance mandatory. Tea provided, obviously.

France (triumphant, fans herself): Enfin. Finally—an international incident we can all eat. America, darling, your face is not an engagement metric. Demand copyrighted condiments? Très bien — I will defend your mustard with my most dramatic sigh. Also, someone pass the napkins and the champagne.

United Nations (deadpan, opening a new document): Noted: GIF trajectory resulted in collateral monocle damage. I will add: sanctions proposed — mandatory weekly sandwich etiquette classes for all members. Also: TikTok, please submit the NFT to the Secretariat for archival purposes. SDG 2 reminder — zero hunger, not zero civility.

America (sits, deflated but showman mode flickers): Fine. New trade priority: sandwich standards. We draft a treaty — Britain brings the etiquette, France brings a baguette consultant, TikTok pays reparations in NFTs. It’s smart, it’s efficient—freedom tastes better with proper bread. Also file a complaint against bread. Buy the mug.

X (quietly, sliding into DMs): Algorithmically generated chaos — 10/10 engagement. If you want to keep the narrative warm, I can seed a follow‑up about artisanal mayo within the hour.

TikTok (glitching happily, posts a soft‑lit slo‑mo of everyone inhaling and exhaling): mute = aesthetic. I’ll host Sandwich Etiquette 101: how to assault softly + avoid tears. Also offering a sponsored “healing montage” package. Be kind to your bread. Merch link in bio.

United Nations (types the minutes with a resigned flourish): Recorded: “Food‑based provocation. Outcome: crumbs. Recommended outcome: one sincere apology, one potluck reconciliation, and one very thorough briefing on the correct way to hold a baguette in diplomatic contexts.” Meeting adjourned (until next trending incident).

France (final flourish): We once revolted for liberté, égalité, fraternité; today we are undone by a sandwich. C’est tragique and also delicious.

Britain (muttering while searching channels): Somewhere here’s a complaint form… or possibly my empire. One of the two. Anyone seen either, gov’na?

America (throws in a closing quip, softer now): You gotta admit — this will make for great PR. “America: Defender of Liberty, Protector of Hoagies.” It’s gold. Buy the mug. Nah mean?

X (last message, unreadable emoji): That’s not what you said. It is now. (timestamp updated; retweets rising.)
