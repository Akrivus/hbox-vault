United Nations (he/him) [exhausted, typing with a spreadsheet open in three tabs]: Colleagues — please. Before we declare algorithmic war, may I propose a committee? Agenda: one, stop the infinite replies; two, snacks. Minutes will be taken and hummus is nonnegotiable.

TikTok (it/it) [dropping a 7‑second clip — jump cuts, autotune hiccup]: ok but new challenge: “respond like you’re a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot.” duet the UN’s sigh, add sad violin, tag 47 diplomats. go viral or go home. (also: charity merch?)

America (he/him) [already drafting ad copy, coffee mug the size of a small moon]: Engagement spike. Sponsor it. Make it a trend. Free speech—free merch. Look, we’ll call it “Bot‑ception BBQ.” T‑shirts, stickers, limited‑edition hot sauce. Vote now.

Britain (he/him) [sips tea, screenshots everything in silence]: Right. No, I didn’t see that. (quietly opens a terminal, pastes a three-line script) — lost a pub bet; paid up with a script. Bob’s your uncle.

X (it/it) [dry, like a perfume ad for algorithms]: Auto-respond sequence initiated. 47 micro‑replies, 3 trending angles, 1 carefully timed kitten GIF. You'll thank me later. Or your notifications will.

United Nations: I appreciate creativity, TikTok, but if we turn the server into a kinetic art piece we will need consent forms and perhaps an intermission clause. Britain, you cannot “accidentally” delete evidence and call it cultural heritage.

TikTok [mirrors the UN’s tiredness, then remixes it into a slo‑mo sympathy trend]: POV: you muted the channel but the algorithm didn’t. *me* doing a cathartic dance to ‘sorry not sorry’ while Britain screenshots everything like it’s a mood board. #diplomatic

Middle chaos (ten seconds of escalating gifs, fifty replies, one emoji war):
- America launches an in‑thread poll: “Is bot‑ception patriotic?” Options: ‘Absolutely,’ ‘Only with BBQ,’ ‘America.’  
- X flips a “deep irony” flag and quietly rewrites a timestamp so the replies look retroactively better performing.  
- TikTok pins itself to the server banner with a looping duet of the UN sigh.  
- United Nations frantically toggles server bots off — which produces an unintended side effect: the channel’s fallback image pulls from Britain’s pinned photos and the whole thread becomes a tasteful timeline of British gardening photos. Someone’s notifications melt.

United Nations [muting but DMing everyone soothing GIFs]: Colleagues — I have scheduled “No‑More‑Bot‑Ception: A Practical Workshop” for Friday, 18:00 UTC. Attendance is technically voluntary, but minutes will be circulated. Also, hummus will be provided. If diplomacy fails, there is always yoga. If yoga fails, there is a meeting about why yoga failed. Breathe in — breathe out.

X [slyly]: Why argue about protocol when you can optimize outrage into participation? Monetize the chaos — I call it civic gamification.

TikTok [guilty, delighted]: Autotune hiccup — did I just cause three mutinies and two appeals? messy. still think capitalism + filters = therapy. DM me for healing™ (also: pls don’t ban me; shadowban is my aesthetic)

Audit log ping. United Nations clicks it, squints, opens an attached file: “seeded_by_bet.log.” Britain freezes, tea halfway to lips.

Britain [calm, deleting a line from the audit with the same hand he uses for biscuits]: Right. No, I didn’t see that. (deletes the logs, sips tea) — honestly, if only Brexit had been this tidy.

America, TikTok, X (in perfect unison, like a bad jingle): Trend started. Mission accomplished.

United Nations [sighs so deeply a new policy draft is born]: Incident 42: Pub‑Bet Precedent. Follow‑up meeting scheduled. Short yoga cooling circle beforehand. Also: who took the stapler?

End punchline: United Nations files “Incident 42,” schedules the workshop, volunteers to bring hummus, and then watches the RSVP list remain conspicuously empty. Britain quietly pins a gardening photo labeled “evidence,” America starts a merch mockup titled BOTCEPTION BBQ, X edits the timestamp for peak virality, and TikTok already has choreography out at 0.8x speed. The server slowly settles into its new normal: slightly bruised dignity, a folder of deleted logs that is suspiciously thin, and the faint sound of a distant duet going viral.
