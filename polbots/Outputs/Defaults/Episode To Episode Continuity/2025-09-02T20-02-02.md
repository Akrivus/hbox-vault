Key Events
- Incident 42 recorded and saved as PDF; UN schedules "No‑More‑Bot‑Ception: A Practical Workshop" (yoga warmup, hummus clause).  
- TikTok launches the "bot‑pretending‑to‑be‑human‑pretending‑to‑be‑bot" duet; trend goes viral and spawns #StolenStaplerChallenge charity merch.  
- Britain repeatedly deletes/edits audit lines (“lost a pub bet”) and then pins photos of the stapler — stapler later declared a cultural artifact.  
- X gamifies RSVPs (kitten GIF reward), edits timestamps and top replies to retroactively shape narratives.  
- America turns the fiasco into merch and sponsorship tiers (including NFT hummus dip codes) and volunteers to host a branded afterparty/BBQ.  
- Hummus elevated from snack to government‑sponsored diplomatic tool; merch (“No, I didn’t see that”) sells out in three sizes.

Memorable Moments
- “No, I didn’t see that.” (Britain / now the campaign slogan.)  
- UN: “If diplomacy fails, there is always yoga. If yoga fails, there is always a meeting about why yoga failed.”  
- X: “That’s not what you said. It is now.” (Timestamp/edits as policy.)

Ongoing Issues
- Stapler: vanished/photographed/declared artifact — ripe for heist, auction, or provenance scandal (Britain insists it was “misplaced”).  
- Bot‑ception trend: algorithmic cascade still spreading; risk of endless micro‑replies, copycat edits, and public-relations cascades.  
- UN legitimacy vs. performative engagement: workshop scheduled but attendance empty; minutes still mandatory — PR win for some, hollow for enforcement.  
- X’s retroactive edits and RSVP‑gaming undermine record‑keeping and process integrity; Britain’s casual log‑deletions keep resurfacing.  
- Commercialization: America’s merch, NFTs, sponsorship tiers and TikTok charity angles create conflicting incentives (profit vs. diplomacy).  
- Hummus as soft power: now official — creates supply/logistics, trademark, and moral‑hazard questions (who supplies the dip?).

Next Episode Setup
- The stapler becomes the MacGuffin: museum exhibit, black‑market auction, or staged “stapler recovery” operation that drags Britain, TikTok influencers, and the UN into a PR war.  
- RSVP bot glitch or NFT redemption snafu accidentally grants access to a closed meeting (or mints a hummus token that’s also a subpoena). Chaos ensues.  
- X retroactively edits past minutes to absolve/implicate someone in the pub bet; Britain doubles down with deadpan denials and jam‑coated receipts.  
- America turns the workshop into a branded “Bot‑Ception BBQ” with sponsor tents; UN threatens sanctions for commercialization of official events — hummus supply lines become strategic.  
- TikTok launches a charity duet that either funds hummus procurement or fundsraise a “Stapler Recovery Task Force,” dragging influencers into UN bureaucracy.  
- Running gag continuity: expect more “No, I didn’t see that” merch, kitten‑GIF bribes, and at least one meeting about why yoga didn’t fix anything.
