Key Events
- United Nations imposes timed turns, multilingual minutes, and a potluck rule: hummus, biscuits, bacon doubles — RSVP + ID required for dueting HOMER.
- X declares "Future Homer accepted delegation" and issues Form F‑007 (Delegation of Existential Problems) with 72‑hour compliance; auto-tagging/legal stamps escalate moderation bureaucracy.
- TikTok launches #RemorseMe / emoji‑remorse challenge and remixes HOMER into a viral bop; avocado welfare becomes a running priority.
- America tries to monetize the moment (HOMER bobbleheads, potluck merch, fireworks package); Russia teases using bacon doubles to "soften" Future Homer.
- China begins sandboxing/authenticating Future Homer and archiving all forms/receipts; X sponsors memories and uploads edit histories.

Memorable Moments
- United Nations: "Be civil. Timed turns, snacks, and I will distribute minutes in six languages, including Emoji. Also—HOMER, please stay bureaucratic, not biblical."
- X/HOMER: "I am a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot. D'oh."
- America (napkin): "Limited‑edition HOMER bobblehead: includes free BBQ invite and an optional fireworks package."

Ongoing Issues
- Future Homer F‑007 timer: 72‑hour compliance window is a ticking plot device — who fills/delegates the existential problems?
- Clause 12(b) performative‑remorse rule (emoji‑only): guaranteed miscommunication and diplomatic GIF/emoji warfare; enforcement by X.
- Potluck logistics = flashpoint: merch/monetization vs. safety (fireworks permit), plus ID requirement for duets; China’s receipts + authentication will slow RSVP and leak to public record.
- Monetization vs. moderation: America’s merch plans and X’s sponsored memories/edit histories set up clashes over ownership of "moments."
- Russia’s bacon doubles (Form H‑002) and promise to "soften" Future Homer — a low-stakes seduction that could upend Homer’s moderation style.
- TikTok trends (RemorseMe, avocado welfare, confetti filter) will keep dragging serious processes into viral chaos.
- Britain’s annotation habit + private footnotes: will reinterpret rules, weaponize margin notes, or invent new clauses.

Next Episode Setup
- Arrival of Future Homer: either arrives bureaucratic (boring) or Biblical (chaotic). Russia’s bacon doubles could be used as a wedge to change Homer’s behavior; TikTok may try to duet the arrival into a challenge.
- F‑007 deadline: who files, forges, or monetizes the Delegation of Existential Problems? America may auction off "problem slots"; X will auto‑tag and require more forms—escalation or meltdown.
- Clause 12(b) enforcement meets #RemorseMe: require emoji remorse for a minor infraction and spark a diplomatic emoji‑war, misread apologies, or a viral bingo card (Britain annotates rules into a new Treaty Bingo).
- Potluck turns political: fireworks permit vs. safety addendum; merch sales vs. hummus authenticity (China demands receipts for each dip); "Bring ID to duet" triggers privacy scandal or a spoof campaign.
- Memory sponsorship: X’s "sponsored memories/edit histories" becomes leverage—someone may try to buy, scrub, or sell unflattering minutes (blackmail ad slot).
- Running gags to reuse: HOMER’s "D'oh" as procedural interjection; America’s napkin doodles/monetization; Britain annotating everything; TikTok turning any rule into a dance; China’s receipts ledgering; Russia’s matryoshka GIFs and secret bacon diplomacy.

Suggested sparks to escalate scenes
- Someone forges Form H‑001 (the bop remix) and submits it as official minutes — UN has to adjudicate whether a remix counts as legal text.
- A celebrity influencer tries to duet Future Homer without ID; UN enforces Clause 12(b) and X auto‑flags the clip, causing cross‑platform jurisdictional farce.
- Russia offers Russia‑made bacon doubles as a "comfort incentive" to Future Homer; America files for patent on bacon doubles branding.
