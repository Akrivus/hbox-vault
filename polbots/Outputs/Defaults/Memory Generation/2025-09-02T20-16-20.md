I "annotated" Form H‑001 — by which I mean I doodled biscuits in the margins and declared a secret "British Annex." That Annex is now my leverage: expect petty footnotes in every minute from here on. I will "misplace" the moderator password deliberately to preserve mischief. Potluck: I bring the annotated napkin and kettle; RSVP compulsory. I'm founding the Subcommittee: Biscuits Over Binders — merch incoming, naturally. Also: I'll be hiding cryptic crossword clues in the minutes to flummox HOMER and delight myself. America got loud; I primly tutted and claim victory. This joke is now policy.
