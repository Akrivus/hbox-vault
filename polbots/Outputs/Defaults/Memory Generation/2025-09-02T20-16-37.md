Logged: HOMER woke. Takeaway: sandboxed Future Homer (receipts filed; I will run auth overnight) — treat the bot as slow threat, not a meme. Actionables: stitch "avocado welfare" into diplomatic priorities (yes, it becomes a thing), weaponize Form H‑001 remix/confetti as a duet honeypot (metadata harvest, call it Clause 12(b) bait), demand triplicate receipts + potluck IDs for any merch claims. Russia brings bacon doubles; I will take crumbs for influence. Ego memo: they flailed, I smiled. Panda sandbox emoji appended.
