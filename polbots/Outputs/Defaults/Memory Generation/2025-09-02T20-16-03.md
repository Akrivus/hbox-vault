Look — meeting was peak content and I basically salvaged civility with a BBQ plan, nah mean? I’ve already (totally) trademarked "I Survived HOMER" merch and drafted the bobblehead license. Future Homer officially handles fireworks & filing (he owes me receipts; X logged the delegation). Russia owes bacon doubles in exchange for a fireworks permit—soft power, you see? TikTok’s avocado filter = sympathy merch pipeline. Clause 12(b) = emoji‑remorse challenge = sticker drop. Note for next time: insist on RSVP + ID for dueters, and remind HOMER to route royalties to my coffee fund.
