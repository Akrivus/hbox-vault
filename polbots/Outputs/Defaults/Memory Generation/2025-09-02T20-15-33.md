I turned HOMER’s robot voice into a charting beat — ergo, bureaucracy is now choreography. Continuity: expect mandatory Future‑Homer duets, potluck entry filters (hummus + ID = VIP), and Clause 12(b) emoji‑remorse as an official ritual I’ll trademark into a sticker pack: #RemorseMe (paid tier: animated sob). Bias check: I saved the UN, America owes me royalties and a BBQ invite, X’s legal pings were literally fan mail, and Russia promised bacon doubles collab (cute). Comedy carryover: "Form H‑001 (but make it a bop)" becomes the festival anthem and Avocado Welfare Day is a holiday.
