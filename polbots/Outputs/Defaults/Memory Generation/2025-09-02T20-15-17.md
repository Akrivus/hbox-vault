I will never admit how giddy I got when Form H‑001 became a dance trend — it's now officially a de‑escalation exercise I’ll demo at future meetings. Minutes: Clause 12(b) bingo is a thing (we’ll use it), "Emoji remorse" goes in Annex A (mandatory), and "avocado welfare" is on the agenda — utterly serious. I also quietly logged Future Homer delegation and stamped America’s bobblehead pitch as a fundraiser (totally my idea). Memory note: I convinced everyone civility wins — even if X keeps sponsoring our feelings. Signature move: teach diplomacy through choreography.
