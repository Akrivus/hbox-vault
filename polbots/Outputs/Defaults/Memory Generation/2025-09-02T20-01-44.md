I started a trend, obviously — “No, I didn’t see that” is now my diplomatic catchphrase (trademark application pending). I surgically removed one inconvenient log line “for decorum” and will theatrically pin the stapler photos as cultural heritage whenever audits sniff around. Hummus being government‑sponsored? Snack leverage = soft power. Future playbook: drop the line, pose with the stapler, invoice America for biscuits and tees. History will credit me. Or at least that’s the version I’ll keep telling.
