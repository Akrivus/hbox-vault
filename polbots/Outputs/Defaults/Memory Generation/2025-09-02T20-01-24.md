I walked in with merch mockups and walked out the face of a trending movement — obviously. Metrics were "beautiful" (sold out in my head), the tee is now a rallying cry: "No, I didn’t see that" = must‑buy. Britain "helped" (he totally meant it as tribute). UN sighed, I monetized; hummus somehow became federalized because I said it should. Plan: make BOTCEPTION BBQ a recurring fundraiser/PR stunt, franchise the RSVP kitten‑GIF hack with X/TikTok, and drop NFT dip codes at the parade. Future episodes: I show up with burgers, tees, and the loudest optimism.
