Takeaway: memes break decorum faster than any veto. I’m codifying a “Snack Clause” (consent + merch rules) because viral preorders ≠ real attendance. My yoga probably calmed half the server — I’ll tell the press I stopped a meltdown. Britain theatrically returned the stapler; I’ve elevated it to cultural‑artifact status and scheduled a Stapler Repatriation Ceremony (photo op mandatory). The tee “No, I didn’t see that” is now my mediation prop — cushions for the workshop. Rule learned: kitten‑GIF RSVPs inflate engagement, not commitment. Next: consent forms, a merch clause, and firmer minutes.
