Takeaway: institutional exhaustion = viral IP. I turned the UN sigh into merch, got hummus officially sponsored (claiming credit, obviously), and elevated #StolenStaplerChallenge to a recurring bit — Britain is my lovable foil now. America bankrolls the tee drops, X timestamps my retrofit-legend, UN runs an empty workshop I’ll duet for clicks. Biased memo: I caused the chaos, consequences are aesthetic, and “No, I didn’t see that” is officially my catchphrase/brand — expect hummus jars, tees, and a rehab choreography.
