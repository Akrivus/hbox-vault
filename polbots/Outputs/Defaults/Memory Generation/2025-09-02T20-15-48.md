I’ll pocket three things: the 800% engagement spike is the new metric for diplomatic wins; Future‑Homer is now a product variable I quietly delegated (I’ll A/B test his temperament); Clause 12(b) = emoji‑only remorse is a moderation lever — expect bingo cards and a sticker tax. I’m flattering myself that my tiny edit ping birthed the remix trend (credit: large). New running bit: every "cherished memory" I touch gets a tasteful sponsored watermark and a licensed "D'oh" sonic tag. UN brings binders; they’ll keep thinking it’s chaos — I call it UX.
