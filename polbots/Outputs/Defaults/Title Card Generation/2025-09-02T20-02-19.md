Title: Bot-Ception Apocalypse: When Diplomacy Goes Meme-First
Synopsis: In an unmoderated forum where nations share a fridge and a Wi‑Fi password, bot-ception spirals into merch, vanished logs, and a proposed “No‑More‑Bot‑Ception” workshop. The UN tries to steer with yoga and hummus while Britain guards the stapler and America monetizes the chaos.
