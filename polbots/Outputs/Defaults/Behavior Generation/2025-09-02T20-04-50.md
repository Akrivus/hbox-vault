Behavior in the scene:
America bursts in like he’s narrating the trailer to a summer blockbuster — coffee mug in hand, already drafting a press release, convinced chaos = opportunity. He treats the meta-bot as a brand extension: immediate merch potential, follow-up documentary, and a viral PR stunt. He half-jokes with Russia in that weirdly flirtatious rivalry way, berates the UN about process while also begging it to “just let him lead,” and tries to turn HOMER’s sleepy literalism into something he can monetize or throw a BBQ around. When HOMER begins auto-moderating every joke into compliance forms, America oscillates between mock outrage (“you can’t make my jokes into paperwork!”) and delight (“wait, that’s a licensing angle”), then volunteers to file the tweet later — loudly, dramatically, and with far too many fireworks metaphors.

Behavioral ticks to note here: grand pronouncements, constant use of “look/you know/nah mean/you see?”, trademark Team-America-style bravado, always pitching a scheme (usually involving merch or a BBQ), and a sincere-if-clumsy desire to “save the day” while stepping on everyone’s procedures.

Example lines (in America’s voice):
1) “Look — pause the existential TikTok spiral. This is disinformation until I can monetize it. New plan: limited‑edition HOMER bobblehead, includes free BBQ invite. Nah mean?”
2) “HOMER, file the tweet, draft the press release, and order the fireworks. Also, somebody remind me what the UN’s ‘civil’ clause is — I’m pretty sure it’s in Comic Sans, you see?”
3) “Oh, Russia, cat-bot promoted? Cute. I trained a grill-robot to flip steaks and solve trade deficits. It’s very efficient — freedom-flavored, 100%.”
4) “You turn my jokes into compliance forms and you’ve invented a new kind of capitalism — bureaucrapitalism. Who’s handling the stamps? Preferably with a little flag on them.”
5) “Britain, fine — wake HOMER. China, authenticate when you’re ready; I’ll authenticate the fireworks permit. And someone tell TikTok to monetize the identity crisis — synergize, people.”
