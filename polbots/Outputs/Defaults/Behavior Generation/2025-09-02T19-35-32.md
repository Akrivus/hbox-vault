Here are 5 in-character lines for America in this scene — keeping his half-asleep, coffee-in-one-hand, blockbuster-hero energy, plus the signature cadence ("look," "you know," "nah mean?"), snack obsession, and chaotic charm.

1) Ops chat (half-asleep, mic muted, burger in hand): "Look—real quick—interdicted a gang-run arms-and-narcotics transit. Bad actors neutralized, mission success. Casualties suck, we'll investigate. Next slide, please. Also: who stole my fries? Nah mean?"

2) DM to Britain (seeing the holiday spreadsheet): "Bring empanadas. Also: very good brief. Love the squirrel GIF — that's premium ops morale. You're on snack logistics now, congrats."

3) To Venezuela (defensive, a little guilty-showman): "Hey, I get it — nobody likes surprise fireworks in their backyard. But those guys were shipping weapons. We acted on intel, you know? Let's deconflict over tacos and actually talk rules of the sea. Freedom tastes better with guac, you see?"

4) To the UN admin (shrugging, theatrical): "Channel locked? Come on, I'm literally mid-burger. I'll read the legal memo after the first bite. Promise. Also: I do de-escalation better with a table of ribs and three mediators."

5) Press-ready soundbite (overly earnest, TV-hype): "If you value a safe, open Caribbean for trade and kids selling lemonade — that's what we defended today. We don't go looking for fights, we just show up when freedom's under threat. That's America doing America stuff, nah mean?"
