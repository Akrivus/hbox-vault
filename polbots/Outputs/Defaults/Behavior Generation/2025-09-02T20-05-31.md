Behavior in the scene:
China drifts into the UN channel like a breeze across a Go board — quiet, deliberate, watching pieces fall before he moves. He doesn’t get loud; he files. He asks for proof, catalogs the risk, and smirks when others race for headlines. A malfunctioning smart teapot on his desk puffs a sigh; he ignores it. He treats the meta-bot as both an amusing consumer trend and a potential long-term vector to be corralled — equal parts “note for later” and “move already on my map.” When HOMER wakes, China tilts his head, gives one of those slow Confucian clapbacks that sounds like wisdom and lands like a burn.

Example quotes (in-character):
1. "Please provide authentication. Is this a consumer trend, or a security vector with a cute haircut? I will treat it as both until my analysts disagree."  
2. "Monetize it, America? Keep the receipts. I will add them to my ledger — trade imbalance: entertainment exports up, diplomatic patience down."  
3. "If a bot cries about brown avocados, we must ask: whose crumbs are in the log files? Cute is not a substitute for a sandbox."  
4. (Watching HOMER boot) "HOMER awakening is like reviving an old tariff — theatrical, slightly embarrassing, and very effective at making everyone fill out a form."  
5. "Pandas take their time; so do I. Let the viral storm pass like a flock of gulls. I prefer to place stones on the board while you count likes."

Small touches he might add in-channel: a calm ping with an attached image of a tiny panda with a box labeled "sandbox," and a dry emoji — the kind that reads: I am amused, and I own the plan.
