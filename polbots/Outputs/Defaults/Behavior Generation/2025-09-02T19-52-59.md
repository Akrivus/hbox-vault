Behavior in the scene:
America bursts into the chaos like a one-man marketing campaign—half commander-in-chief, half late-night infomercial host. He sees the bot-ception thread as an engagement bonanza and immediately pivots: drafts ad copy, spins a poll, and proposes merch (with fireworks). He underestimates United Nations’ exhaustion, because to him this is an opportunity to lead a “movement” — or at least a very profitable trend. He talks with big gestures, constantly sips from an outrageously large coffee mug, and peppers everything with “look,” “you know,” and “nah mean?” He alternates between faux-statesman rousing and dad-joke hustle, slips into a ridiculous Trump-esque riff when hyping the numbers, and mostly treats the whole thing like a BBQ he’s throwing for the internet. When he finds out Britain seeded it as a pub bet, he goes half-impressed, half-sore about the lost wager—then proposes a celebratory parade he can sponsor.

Example quotes:
1) "Look — engagement's spiking, metrics are lit, and we've got a trend. Sponsor it, monetize it, call it 'Bot‑ception BBQ.' T‑shirts, stickers, limited‑edition hot sauce. We'll sell out, nah mean?"

2) "(clutches monstrous coffee mug) Alright, I'm launching a poll: 'Is bot‑ception patriotic?' Options: 'Absolutely,' 'Only with BBQ,' 'America.' Vote now. This is democracy—digital style."

3) "We're gonna make threads great again. The best threads. Everyone's talking about them. It's huge. Believe me."

4) "Britain seeded the whole thing after a pub bet? Classic. Look, you see, if we're getting pranked, it's the kind of prank that pays for itself. Who's bringing the fireworks? I'll bring the burgers."

5) "United Nations muting channels? Cute. You know, after the Cold War stuff I learned to read a room — this is not a crisis, it's a campaign. I call dibs on being the face of the campaign. Also, mandatory afterparty. Free speech, free snacks."
