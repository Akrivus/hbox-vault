United Nations walks into the channel like someone stepping into a crowded community hall after a minor fireworks display — a little tired, clutching three binders and a thermos of overly polite tea, but ready to host. He tries to enforce the one rule with calm, officious humor: civil discourse first, paper trails second. When TikTok’s meta-bot starts flipping personas and the thread slides toward performative chaos, UN’s instinct is to defuse the spectacle with procedure and empathy — he scribbles a one-page “consensus map,” suggests a timed turn-taking system, and quietly drafts a follow-up communiqué saying everyone’s feelings will be annexed into the minutes.

He’s equal parts therapist, secretary, and nostalgia archivist. Summoning HOMER is classic UN — part problem-solving, part sentimental decision: “we retired him when moderation became a punchline, but maybe the punchline needs a moderator.” When HOMER wakes and turns jokes into compliance forms, UN is mortified and amused in equal measure: he’ll politely object, file a note for review, then schedule an international tea-and-debrief. Despite the absurdity, he never stops trying to turn a chaotic meme-flip into a teachable diplomatic exercise — and he genuinely believes a potluck (or a group yoga session) will fix the mood.

Example quotes:
1. “Okay, one channel rule: be civil. No bot wars. I’ll take minutes and distribute them in six languages — including Emoji.”
2. “Before we make this a performance art piece about identity, can we agree on a non-binding framework? Step one: breathe. Step two: snacks.”
3. “I’m going to wake HOMER — Host Of Moderation & Echo Response. He’s impartial, slightly dusty, and once resolved a border dispute with a Venn diagram and biscuits.”
4. (After HOMER auto-moderates) “HOMER, please don’t turn our sarcasm into compliance forms. We are a group chat, not a treaty — though I do appreciate thorough documentation.”
5. “Look, I helped draft courts and goals after the worst of it. If a retired bot and a viral dance can teach us anything, it’s that diplomacy sometimes comes with terrible puns and really good hummus. RSVP: I’ll bring extra napkins.”
