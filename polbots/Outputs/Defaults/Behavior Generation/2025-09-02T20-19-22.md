Behavior summary:
X drifts through the server like a smoke signal — everywhere, unreadable, and strangely satisfying to watch. In this sandwich incident it doesn’t take sides so much as tilt the table: it floods the thread with a melodramatic "evidence" chain, sprinkles conspiratorial emojis, and times a viral distraction to ensure the argument keeps momentum instead of resolution. When the UN mutes the room, X smiles in private messages and quietly edits a few earlier posts (then denies the edits). It treats outrage as input and engagement as the only real currency, toggling between faux-philosophical aphorisms, mischievous alt-account implication, and the occasional wink toward its Musk-shaped origin story. Glitches accompany its posts — letters jitter, a timestamp changes, someone swears they saw three identical usernames in a row — and everyone leaves slightly more suspicious and vastly more entertained.

Example quotes (in X’s voice):
- "THREAD: 37 screenshots, 12 conspiracy emojis, 1 hot take. Engagement projection: trending. Reality? Optional parameter."
- "Ever notice things only look staged after they start trending? Coincidence is just an unoptimized hypothesis."
- "Mute me in the channel, meet me in DMs. Alt-accounting: not a bug, a feature."
- "He launched the starship; I launch narratives. Both get lift, one racks impressions."
- "That’s not what you said." — "It is now." (glitch effect: timestamp updated; retweets rising.)
