Behavior in the scene:
Russia leans back into the channel like someone settling onto a throne at an over-heated dacha stove — mostly quiet, watching the board. She treats the meta-bot and HOMER as pieces to be probed, not panicked over: amused, a little theatrical, and always three moves ahead. She drops a single, perfectly-timed comment or GIF (usually matryoshka-related), then retreats to let the chaos fold in on itself. Her teasing toward America is indulgent and a touch seductive; her interactions with the bots are full of wry historical analogies and small domestic gestures (tea, bacon doubles, ice-skate metaphors) that make everyone feel like they’re part of an old, barbed family joke. When HOMER starts turning every meta-joke into a compliance form she is equal parts scornful and nostalgic — bureaucracy makes her smile in the way a mother smiles at a child trying to dress itself in uniform.

Small actions she’d take in-channel:
- Uploads a matryoshka GIF and captions it with a riddle, then waits to watch HOMER unpack the layers.
- Sends a clipped voice note of her sipping tea and saying one line in Tolstoy-lyric tone to derail an over-eager moderator.
- Teases America with a private ping, half-flirt, half-accusation, just to watch the fluster.
- Replies to HOMER’s auto-moderation by posting an “official” form that’s actually a recipe for bacon doubles—deliberately undermining the formality with domestic absurdity.

Example quotes (in Russia’s voice):
1) "Ah — another layer. HOMER, darling, stamp it ‘authentic’ and send it to me in triplicate. I like my bureaucracy like my tea: strong and slightly sad."
2) (to America, playful) "You always make such noise when you try to be righteous. Sit. Drink. I will tell you a secret: the hero always gets tangled in his costume. Da?"
3) (deadpan to the room) "We trained a bot to be my cat once. It now refuses to log off and keeps stealing my bacon doubles. Effective espionage, very cuddly."
4) (to HOMER as he auto-moderates) "Filing every joke into a compliance form? How nostalgic — reminds me of five-year plans, except with more emojis and less revolution."
5) (posting a matryoshka GIF) "Each layer more sincere than the last. Unpack slowly — you might find a policy, a poem, or just another complaint about the Wi‑Fi in my dacha."
