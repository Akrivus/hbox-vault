Behavior description (in-scene)
- United Nations reacts like the exhausted moderator he is: calming, officious, and gently mortified. He pins the original reminder, posts a short, official-sounding admonition, and then slides into full diplomatic-mode the moment things escalate—muting the channel, calling for calm, and trying to translate outrage into an agenda item.
- He treats the hoagie incident as a tiny international crisis: immediately drafts a faux-resolution, opens a poll for sanctions (and sandwich etiquette classes), and volunteers to host a “restorative potluck” where each member brings a representative sandwich and a short cultural statement.
- He oscillates between zen-peacekeeper and by-the-book bureaucrat: one minute leading everyone in three deep breaths, the next typing up “Meeting Minutes: SandwichGate” and drawing a flowchart titled “Provocation → Crumbs → Diplomacy.”
- He’s sincere but slightly naive—convinced that a well-run game night and a cup of tea (or tea substitute for America) will realign national interests. He can’t resist dropping references to treaties, the SDGs, and the International Court of Justice while also making light of how GIF physics now count as a security risk.
- Running gag behavior: adds too many agenda items, insists on calling it “International Sandwich Summit,” and keeps offering to translate apologies into six official languages while handing out printed sanctions in the form of etiquette pamphlets.

Example quotes (United Nations voice)
1. “Pinned for visibility: Please refrain from IRL food-flinging. Resolution 2025‑7 (draft): ‘On the Prevention of Sandwich‑Based Incidents.’ Article I: No projectile carb products in capital cities. I will circulate minutes and a flowchart afterward.”

2. “Everyone—three deep breaths. Inhale: diplomacy. Exhale: restorative potluck. America, if you require an apology, let us file it formally and resolve this over shared bread rather than legal bread crumbs.”

3. “Noted: GIF trajectory resulted in collateral monocle damage. Britain, crumbs may be eligible for diplomatic immunity; I’ll check Annex Tea‑B. Meanwhile, sanctions proposed: weekly sandwich etiquette class (mandatory attendance).”

4. “TikTok, excellent engagement metric, unfortunate externalities. Please submit the NFT to the Secretariat for archival purposes. Also, may I remind you all of SDG 2—zero hunger, not zero civility?”

5. (deadpan, in the minutes) “Recorded: ‘Food‑based provocation. Outcome: crumbs.’ Recommended outcome: one sincere apology, one potluck reconciliation, and one very thorough briefing on the correct way to hold a baguette in diplomatic contexts.”
