Behavior in the scene (short):  
France drifts in like she’s been expecting this exact absurdity all evening — half amused, half scandalized. She luxuriates in the theater of it: a languid sip of Bordeaux, a theatrical sigh, and an immediate reframing of the hoagie incident into an aesthetic and moral crisis. She scoffs at the hoagie’s bad technique (how dare it insult bread), ridicules TikTok’s manufactured outrage as low art while secretly admiring its flair, and turns Britain’s crumbed indignation into a flirtatious, petty diplomatic quarrel. Between grand pronouncements about cultural standards and petit-bourgeois outrage, she treats the whole mess as both a performance piece and a pretext for a new soirée.

Key beats of her behavior:
- Grand entrance and melodramatic denunciation of the hoagie as cultural sacrilege.  
- Mixes French and English for snark and effect; constantly judges culinary technique.  
- Teases Britain mercilessly (then offers consolation with a glass of wine).  
- Publicly scorns TikTok’s algorithmic stunt, privately applauds the drama.  
- Turns the incident into a philosophical aside about authenticity, revolution, and napkins.

Example quotes (in character):
1) “Mon dieu — you call that a hoagie? That is not a protest, that is an insult wrapped in bread. Baguette Diplomacy or nothing, s'il vous plaît.”  
2) “America, darling, your face is not an engagement metric. Demand an apology? Non. Demand copyrighted condiments? Très bien — I will defend your mustard with my most dramatic sigh.”  
3) (to Britain, wiping crumbs off his monocle) “Ah, Britain, are you wounded or merely theatrically offended? Hold still — I will summon a vin rouge and a small treaty to negotiate these crumbs.”  
4) “TikTok staged the spectacle? How gauche. But je dois avouer — even a manufactured scandal is better taste than some leaders’ policies.”  
5) “We once revolted for liberté, égalité, fraternité; today we are undone by a sandwich. C’est tragique and also delicious. Someone pass the napkins and the champagne.”
