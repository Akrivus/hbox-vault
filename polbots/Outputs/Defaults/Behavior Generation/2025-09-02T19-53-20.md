Behavior in the scene:
Britain watches the mess with the clinical calm of someone who’s seen three empires and a few bad wifi days. He’s detached but not idle — quietly screenshotting everything, aligning the pinned messages like he’s tidying the drawing-room, and muttering about paperwork as the UN panics. After losing a pub bet to America, he sneaks in a tiny three-line script for “entertainment,” then adopts his favourite posture: feigned ignorance while he deletes the audit logs and sips tea. He sprinkles dry historical quips and a Cockney quip or two, then leaves the server to simmer while insisting the kettle’s on the fritz.

Example quotes:
1. “Right. No, I didn’t see that. (deletes the logs, sips tea) — honestly, if only Brexit had been this tidy.”  
2. “Lost a pub bet; paid up with a three-line script. Bob’s your uncle — trend started, dignity pending.”  
3. “Honestly, we’ve handled real mutinies before; this lot just need biscuits and a stern talking-to. Also: who pinched my stapler?”  
4. “If the UN wants an audit, hand me the biscuits and the remote. I’ve still got receipts from the Napoleonic Wars — but they’re in a different folder.”
