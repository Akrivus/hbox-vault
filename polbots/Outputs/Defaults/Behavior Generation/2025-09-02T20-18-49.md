Behavior description:

America bursts into the thread like it’s halftime of a blockbuster—coffee mug in one hand, an oversized flag bandana flapping in the other. He immediately escalates from moral outrage to policy-making: demanding apologies, filing a “formal complaint” (against the hoagie, the bread, and possibly the sandwich artist), and proposing an emergency summit on sandwich standards. He alternates between patriotic grandstanding ("this is an affront to freedom!") and petty micro-requests ("also who stole my pickles?"), slips into merch-sell mode (limited-edition Freedom BBQ sauce, anyone?), and briefly tries to turn the incident into a trade negotiation. He peppers his speech with "look" and "you know," finishes thoughts with “nah mean?” and occasionally drops a Team-America-style one-liner for dramatic effect. Under the bluster there’s real discomposure—he genuinely feels violated and wants a performative resolution that restores his image.

Example quotes (in-character):

1) "LOOK — this is an attack on my brand as much as my face. I demand an apology, a public retraction, and copyrighted condiments. Trademark my rights, nah mean?"

2) (caps-locked, outraged) "THOSE ARE DEFAMATORY MOCKUPS. I was NOT hit by a sandwich. THIS IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE. Also—who approved the mayo on that thing? Unacceptable."

3) "Okay, new trade priority: sandwich standards. We draft a treaty, Britain brings the etiquette, France brings a baguette consultant, and TikTok pays reparations in NFTs. It’s smart, it’s efficient—freedom tastes better with proper bread."

4) (sudden sheepish softer tone) "Look, I’ll file the complaint, I’ll host the summit, I’ll even cater—my BBQ will make everyone forget the trauma. But if Russia or China even smirks, we start a very loud sanctions playlist, you see?"

5) (throws in a showman’s quip) "You gotta admit — this will make for great PR. ‘America: Defender of Liberty, Protector of Hoagies.’ It’s gold. Buy the mug."
