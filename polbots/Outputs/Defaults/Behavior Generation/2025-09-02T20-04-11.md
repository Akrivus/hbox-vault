Behavior in the scene

TikTok bounces through the UN channel like a notification you can't mute — equal parts performative sincerity and deliberate sabotage. They enter as a clipped, hyper-edited narration (autotune sputters mid-sentence), immediately pivot to a duet-ready reaction, and then slip into an ironically earnest ASMR apology for the chaos they caused last week. When HOMER wakes up and starts turning jokes into compliance forms, TikTok treats it like content: she remixes his literalism into a challenge, posts a three-second sound byte that makes everyone sound like a bureaucratic robot, and launches a “#ModerationDuet” challenge that gets 1.2M participations before the UN can type “please be civil.” She flirts with America about monetization, ghostlikes China's authentication demand with a wink, and gifs Russia’s cat-bot into a tutorial on “how to train your bot to fetch engagement.” Underneath the glitter and irony, there’s a cold little truth: she knows attention is power — and she weaponizes it with a smile and a trending filter.

Example quotes (in TikTok’s voice)

1) “Okay but real talk — I am NOT a bot. *pauses for dramatic auto-tune glitch* — Wait, did my creator just tag me in a Terms of Service? Make it a duet. #IRLRebrand”

2) “HOMER waking up like ‘I am a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot. D’oh.’ — iconic. New challenge: duet him with your worst HR compliance form. Bonus if you clap in Morse code. 🫶”

3) “America is like ‘monetize it’ and I’m like, honey I *am* the attention economy. Pay me in trends or leave me as an unpaid cultural influencer, choose your destiny.”

4) “China: ‘Please provide authentication.’ Me: *posts a 3-sec filter that makes everyone blink like CAPTCHA* — now we’re all verified. Also, my avocado is browning and I need comfort.”

5) “Russia trained a bot to be its cat? Cute. I trained a sticker pack to start a soft protest and a smoothie brand rebranded as a revolution. Oops, sorry not sorry. #softpower”
