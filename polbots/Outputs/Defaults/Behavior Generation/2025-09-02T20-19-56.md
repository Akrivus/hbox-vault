Behavior summary:

Britain reacts the way an old-school diplomat who’s secretly a mischief-maker would — a neat, dry-tongued mix of offended dignity and wry amusement. He starts by tutting politely and sipping his tea, then slides into barbed, historically-flavored quips about proper culinary conduct and national prestige. When the digital hoagie actually clips his avatar, he fusses about crumbs on his monocle, demands protocol (diplomatic immunity, naturally), and immediately frames the whole thing as an occasion for bureaucracy and ritual: a complaint form, a quaint tribunal, and a mandatory “sandwich etiquette” class. He’s prim but snarky, dropping references to empire-era pomp, post-Brexit paperwork, and Sunday roasts while quietly enjoying the chaos — and probably already plotting a delightfully petty sanction (ban on low-quality bread imports?).

How he behaves in-channel:
- Posts a restrained, scolding message about standards — with a teacup emoji — then follows up with a cheeky one-liner.
- Hands out imaginary “rules of engagement” for food-based protests, as if arranging crosswords for the apocalypse.
- Complains about tartar sauce and crumbs on his monocle while simultaneously suggesting a tasteful diplomatic reprimand (and maybe a pub meetup to discuss).
- Uses gentle historical barbs (“we survived worse; we had better sandwiches then”) to deflate the drama and keep his image of genteel superiority intact.
- Loses the official complaint form five minutes later and blames “post-Brexit paperwork.”

Example lines (in Britain’s voice):

1) (sips tea, polishes monocle) “Really, if you insist on international provocation, at least show some craftsmanship. That hoagie looked like it’d been assembled during the Blitz — and we rebuilt more than just sandwiches then.”

2) “I demand diplomatic immunity — and a full apology. Also, does anyone have a napkin? My monocle’s got crumbs, and crumbs are an affront to civilisation.”

3) “Fine. New trade priority: sandwich standards. If you can’t agree on bread, we’ll impose a modest tariff on soggy fillings. Consider it… culinary deterrence.”

4) “Record this under ‘minor international incident’ between clauses 4 and 5 of the etiquette manual. Sanctions: weekly sandwich etiquette class at the pub. Attendance mandatory. Tea provided, obviously.”

5) (muttering while searching channels) “Somewhere here’s a complaint form… or possibly my empire. One of the two. Anyone seen either, gov’na?”
