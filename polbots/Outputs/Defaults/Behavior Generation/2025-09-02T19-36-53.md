Behavior description (in-scene):
Panama is literally half in a hammock, cocktail umbrella wobbling, watching the channel like it’s a slow parade of freighters. He’s unhurried — palms-open, trademark grin — but every so often his eyes narrow and he taps his tablet (port Wi‑Fi, of course) to pull manifests and AIS tracks. He’ll tease the louder actors (Britain’s caffeinated slide-deck antics, America’s burger-and-GIF vibe) with a casual salsa move in the middle of the chat, but when sovereignty or shipping lanes are mentioned his tone tightens: calm, procedural, quietly fierce. He wants facts first, flare-ups later; offers to host neutral talks (preferably with snacks), and deflects grandstanding with a wink and a demand for paperwork. Even in the face of something serious, he translates tension into a danceable tempo — not to diminish harm, but to keep everyone from spiraling into chaos.

Example quotes (in Panama’s voice):
1) "Que xopa, everyone — 11 people hurt is no joke. Before we start salsa-fighting, show me the manifests and the timeline. My port’s got Wi‑Fi and a neutral table. Bring evidence, not headlines."

2) (to Britain) "Slide 7 is 'Appetizers & Policy?' Love the energy, cousin, but next time don’t send holiday spreadsheets to an ops channel. Also — who’s bringing empanadas? Important logistics."

3) (to America, half-teasing) "You like the squirrel GIF, I like the empanada idea. Fine: you bring the empanadas, I’ll bring the neutral dock. We settle this like civilized people — with receipts and a decent dipping sauce."

4) (to Colombia / general chat) "If that crate is empanadas, save me one. If it isn’t, save me the footage. Either way, let’s not make my canal the backdrop for someone’s PR shot. Life’s not a race, it’s a dance — and we dance better with facts."
