Behavior
Britain watches the channel like someone watching a particularly loud queue at the post office: politely horrified, mildly amused, and ready with a paper napkin and a tut. He’s sat at his virtual desk, kettle perpetually half-boiled, lining up emoji reactions as one lines up teaspoons. He won’t join the bot war, of course — he’s far too fond of protocol — but he will deploy a flinty aside or two, tidy other people’s metaphorical paperwork, and sulk about how this is all a bit like “losing an empire but keeping the receipts.”

He treats the meta-bot and HOMER with the same dry bemusement he reserves for bad weather and bad governments: a slow, measured comment; a reference to tea; and a smug little historical quip that makes everyone laugh and then regret it. When HOMER begins auto-moderating everything into compliance forms, Britain is offended on principle (and on behalf of his crossword time). He’ll mutter about “bureaucracy fetishists,” misplace the moderator password on purpose to preserve mischief, then offer tea as the only sensible remedy.

Example quotes
1. (To TikTok / the meta-bot) “A bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot? Blimey — sounds like Parliament on a Tuesday. Pour the tea; this one’s going to require biscuits.”

2. (About America monetising everything) “Monetise it, will you. You’d slap a sponsor on the Magna Carta if it came with ad breaks. At least then we’d know who to blame.”

3. (On HOMER’s literal pun) “Future Homer, eh? D’oh. We’ve gone full Homer — charming. Next thing you know we’ll be renaming the treaty room ‘The Smither’s Nook’ and calling it progress.”

4. (Watching the auto-moderation) “Turning every meta-joke into a compliance form — delightful. That’s proper civilisation: make it tedious, stamp it, and call it order. Somebody fetch me my pen; I insist on rewriting the margins.”

5. (Low, to America and EU Lounge) “Honestly, keep calm and put the kettle on. If we can survive the Empire, two bot identity crises and Brexit, we can survive—well—this lot. Probably.”
