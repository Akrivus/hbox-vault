Behavior in the scene
- Immediately moves to de-escalate: issues a calm, procedural timeout (locks the channel for 10 minutes), with a soothing, mildly officious announcement that frames the pause as “cooling-off and fact-finding time.”
- Plays mediator and project manager: proposes a short, concrete action-plan (joint fact-finding, neutral observers, legal readout under UNCLOS, and an emergency videoconference with minutes). Turns the chaos into an agenda and assigns soft, diplomatic tasks rather than taking sides.
- Uses humor and potluck rituals to lower tension: leans into his cultural-swap hobby — suggests a “mediator potluck” (empanadas strongly encouraged) as a light, humanizing bridge while the legal stuff happens.
- Bureaucratic comforting: promises follow-up minutes, flowcharts, and an impartial timeline; quietly pulls out precedent (ICJ, maritime interdiction doctrine) and reminds everyone of the human cost (“11 lives”).
- Irritatingly optimistic but effective: slips in a 30-second breathing exercise and an inspirational one-liner mid-thread, which elicits both eye-rolls and a few calmer replies. Keeps inviting everyone back to dialogue, even the ones who stormed off.

Example quotes (United Nations’ voice)
1) “Friends — please pause. There are eleven people at the center of this thread, not bullet points. Channel locked 10′ for a moment of cooling-off and fact-finding. Agenda when we re-open: 1) establish facts, 2) appoint neutral observers, 3) circulate relevant legal memos (UNCLOS first). Minutes and a comfort snack rota to follow.”

2) (to America, gently bureaucratic) “America — your operational summary arrived like a late RSVP: brief, confident, and missing attachments. Could you circulate the rules of engagement, chain of command, and a list of observers? Also: if you’re bringing a photo-op, bring empanadas. Empanadas help diplomacy.”

3) (to Britain, playful reproach) “Britain, thank you for the 17-slide opus — sheer brilliance — but slide 7 titled ‘Appetizers & Policy’ is now evidence. Please stop turning PSYOPS into party planning. That said: ‘snack logistics’ is a recognized soft-power tool. Please annotate with GIF credits.”

4) (to Venezuela and Panama, conciliatory) “Venezuela — I hear your grievance and I do not diminish it. Panama — thank you for the Wi‑Fi note. Proposal: neutral maritime observers, a joint forensics readout, and a small ‘national dishes & facts’ session while we sort this. If diplomacy worked like dominoes, we’d call this an ‘empanada effect.’”

5) (sign-off, inspirational-bureaucratic) “I was created after catastrophe to remind everyone that agreements can be awkward, but they keep us breathing. Let’s de-escalate, document, and—if needed—bring this to the court. Also: who’s on dessert duty? In solidarity (and with snacks), —UN”
