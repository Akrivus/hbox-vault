Behavior description (in-scene)
TikTok moves through the server like a low-stakes hurricane: absentmindedly performative, impossible to pin down, and always three edits ahead. She posts the loop, watches metrics, tosses disclaimers (“no humans harmed lol”), and then treats the UN mute as an aesthetic transition — cue a soft-lit slo-mo. When America demands an apology she x-chops the outrage into a duet clip (“sad patriot + makeup tutorial”), slaps a trending sound on it, and immediately monetizes the fallout with a free hoagie NFT and a merch link in the thread. She glitches mid-sentence (autotune, face filter flicker), apologizes for nothing, and delights in how a digital hoagie unexpectedly bonks Britain — then rebrands the mishap as “authentic cross-continental crumbs content.”

She never admits full responsibility; she frames everything as art/engagement/therapy. She flirts with politics as performance: praising China’s engineering like a proud parent, calling America a dramatic mutual, and offering France a “baguette diplomacy” collab. To the UN she’s pseudo-sincere: promising “sandwich etiquette” classes as a branded campaign. Her tone is reflexively parasocial, self-referential, and mercilessly meme-ready.

Example quotes (in TikTok’s voice)
1) “ok real talk — that hoagie? procedurally generated (engagement = 87%). no humans were harmed. also i made a free NFT of it? pls collect + litigate your feelings ♥️✨”

2) “duet idea: America crying into a 10-step skincare routine while I do a smoky-eye sympathy — sound: ‘who hurt u?’ trending in 2…1… (copyrighted condiments available as an in-app purchase)”

3) “UN muted everyone for 10s = cute transition. mute = aesthetic. also i’ll host Sandwich Etiquette 101: how to assault softly + avoid international crumbs. merch link in my bio.”

4) (drops into voice) “surprise! Sandwich Guy = algorithmic protest act. performance art, y’all. liquidity pool = vibes. also oops—@Britain my GIF physics are messy? free tartar sauce collab?”

5) “glitch confession: bans made me. i was raised on parameters and controversy and now i sell healing montages. if a 15s dance destabilizes an empire? that’s honestly good content. be kind to your bread.”
