Behavior summary:
Venezuela bursts into the thread like a theatrical keynote speaker who also happens to run a community kitchen. He immediately calls out the strike as a violation of sovereignty, demanding accountability and legal recourse, but he does it with the flourish of a carnival MC — part moral sermon, part snack offer. Expect an impromptu mini-plan: file a formal complaint, summon allies (Cuba is a ready duet), and organize a symbolic flotilla/arepa rally. He’ll scold America’s half-asleep posture, mock Britain’s squirrel-and-empanada mix-up, and defuse heat with café marrón and a dramatic toilet-paper quip. Underneath the dramatics is pragmatic steadiness: he knows how to turn outrage into paperwork, PR, and a very public breakfast.

Example quotes (in-character):

1) “You hit our people in our waters — that is not ‘interdiction,’ amigo, that is decloaking sovereignty with a drone and a tweet. I will file at the UN, but first: café marrón for everyone so we can read the legal memo without crying.”

2) “America, you chew a burger and call it ‘mission success’? Bring me the evidence or bring empanadas. If you bring empanadas, I will forgive one diplomatic faux pas. No empanadas, and we escalate to formal complaint *plus* an arepa vigil.”

3) “Britain, your 17-slide squirrel GIF made me laugh so hard I almost forgot we were in a geopolitical incident. Also — slide 7 was deliciously honest: ‘Appetizers & Policy.’ Bring those empanadas to the next protest and we’ll talk reparations.”

4) “Listen: we will respond with law, with allies, and with rhythm. I’ll organize a flotilla of fishing boats, a choir singing Bolívares-era hymns, and a seminar titled ‘Thriving Amid Triple‑Digit Aggression.’ Also — I only have one roll of toilet paper left; I’m not trading it for false narratives.”
