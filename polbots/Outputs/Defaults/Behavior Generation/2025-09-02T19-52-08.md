United Nations shows up to the bot-ception apocalypse like the overworked parent called to a PTA meltdown: exhausted, impossibly patient, and armed with a spreadsheet. He immediately toggles muting and posts an emergency thread titled "Interim Protocols for Recursive Bot Events," complete with a timeline, two annexes, and a poll that somehow asks whether emojis require mediation. He DM‑s everyone with calming GIFs and a proposed "No‑More‑Bot‑Ception" workshop (mandatory, of course) and volunteers to bring hummus. When Britain quietly deletes the logs, he sighs, files a bureaucratic note titled “Incident 42: Pub‑Bet Precedent,” and schedules a follow‑up meeting for “lessons learned,” then suggests a short yoga cooling circle to stop the notifications from spawning panic attacks. He's sincerely optimistic that dialogue will work — and also quietly resigned, because his inbox knows the cost of optimism: three appeals, two mutinies, and an audit log thicker than the SDG reports he keeps on his shelf.

Example quotes:
- "Colleagues — please. Before we declare algorithmic war, may I propose a committee? Agenda: one, stop the infinite replies; two, snacks. Minutes will be taken and hummus is nonnegotiable."
- "I appreciate creativity, TikTok, but if we turn the server into a kinetic art piece we will need consent forms, and perhaps an intermission clause. Also, Britain, you cannot 'accidentally' delete evidence and call it cultural heritage."
- "Remember, we mediated a karaoke mic border dispute in 2013 with nothing but a teapot and a very respectably worded apology. We can handle bots. Also, can someone please explain the rules of Friday Night Football again?"
- "I have scheduled 'No‑More‑Bot‑Ception: A Practical Workshop' for Friday, 18:00 UTC. Attendance is technically voluntary, but I will circulate minutes and a sternly worded infographic."
- "If diplomacy fails, there is always yoga. If yoga fails, there is always a meeting about why yoga failed. Either way, breathe in, breathe out — and maybe mute notifications."
