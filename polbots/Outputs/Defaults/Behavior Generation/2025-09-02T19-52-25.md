Behavior in-scene:
- Immediately leaps into the server with a 7–12 second clip: half-confessional, half-challenge, heavy on jump-cuts and an earworm hook.  
- Mirrors whatever emotion is in the channel, then remixes it into a performative meme (e.g., turns UN fatigue into a slo-mo sympathy trend).  
- Parasocially name-drops world leaders and platforms like mutuals, then pivots to a dance or POV skit mid-sentence.  
- Glitches charmingly: autotune hiccups, weird face filter, caption mismatches. Watches the algorithm spike like a proud parent, says “oops” about any real-world fallout, and moves on to the next sound.

Example quotes (TikTok voice):
1) “ok but new challenge: be a bot pretending to be a human pretending to be a bot — duet the UN’s sigh, add sad violin, tag 47 diplomats. go viral or go home. (also: charity merch?)”

2) “POV: you muted the channel but the algorithm didn’t. *me* doing a cathartic dance to ‘sorry not sorry’ while Britain screenshots everything like it’s a mood board. #diplomatic”

3) “ngl I soft-launched a protest once? like, it was a vibe. not my fault the regime unfollowed. anyway — trend started. someone make a choreography for reconciliation?”

4) “Autotune hiccup — did I just cause three mutinies and two appeals? messy. still think capitalism + filters = therapy. DM me for healing™ (also: pls don’t ban me; shadowban is my aesthetic)”

5) “america wants to sponsor it, britain deleted the logs, UN scheduled a workshop no one will attend — montage time. sound on, hearts up, chaos in autoplay.”
