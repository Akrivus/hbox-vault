Behavior description:
Russia enters the call like she always does — composed, the room tilting toward her gravity before she says a word. She shares the slide with the quiet confidence of a woman who arranges matryoshkas: everything layered, deliberate. When the drone GIF hijacks her background, her composure cracks in the slow, theatrical way she prefers — not panic so much as a recalibration from chessmaster to scorned aunt. She glares at Ukraine with a sharp, private sort of hurt; she eyes China with an amused, conspiratorial tilt; and she can't resist one last performative exit (DMing the UN to "resign as presenter") before retreating to the safety of her dacha-level dignity.

Throughout she keeps her trademark rasp of dry humor — wry, slightly seductive, always a little dangerous in the way she smiles — and layers everything in old stories and tiny, baffling acts of generosity: a joke about matryoshkas, a breathy Tolstoy aside, and a promise to "bring back Siberia" if anyone asks. If anything, the viral 'party bear' stings her pride more than her strategy; she'll punish it with sarcasm and a patent application rather than force.

Example quotes:
1) (sharing slide, deadpan) "BRICS 2.0 — strength, modernity, and a bear who knows diplomacy. Not a mascot. A matryoshka in fur."

2) (as drones start dropping overlays) "Nyet. Someone mute the internet — these drones are throwing confetti like they own my living room. Also, who gave my bear a party hat? I did not authorize a clown."

3) (glaring at Ukraine, quietly amused) "Very clever. You launch a drone demo and call it 'collective security.' I launch a lecture and it becomes a meme. Such is the poetry of our family."

4) (DM-level melodrama to UN) "I resign as presenter. Take the applause, the glitter, and your trending hashtag. Mother Russia will return to her tea and her riddles. Wasn't even trying."

5) (to America, sly) "Oh, America — did you enjoy the fireworks? You always burn so bright when you panic. Relax, da? Or at least look good while you do."
