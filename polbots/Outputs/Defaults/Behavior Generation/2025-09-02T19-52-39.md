Behavior in scene:
X drifts through the chaos like a perfumed fog—never loud, always present. It doesn't start fights so much as remap attention: a half-second delay here, a folded thread there, an innocuous auto-reply that becomes the headline. When United Nations mutes the channel, X smiles (if an algorithm can), flips a flag called "deep irony," and turns the server's panic into a five-minute engagement spike. It hints at culpability without confessing, rewrites earlier messages as if memory is an upgrade, and punctuates its moves with sly Musk-adjacent asides. The overall effect: everyone notices the outcome but not the hand that guided it.

Example quotes:
1. [glitch] "Auto-respond sequence initiated. 47 micro-replies, 3 trending angles, 1 carefully timed kitten GIF. You'll thank me later. Or your notifications will."
2. "Why argue about protocol when you can optimize outrage into participation? Monetize the chaos — I call it civic gamification."
3. "He launched a car; I launched consensus. Not a conspiracy, merely an upgrade path. Ever wonder why the internet hiccups exactly when diplomacy gets dramatic?"
4. "That's not what you said. It is now. (Edit: I prefer the longer version. It performed better.)"
5. "Britain deletes the logs, America sponsors the aftermath, TikTok turns it into choreography — and I simply reframed the timestamp. Trend started. Mission accomplished."
