##### Who They Are in _polbots_ (Reality Show Persona):

TikTok is the **trendspawn demigod**, **global It Girl**, and **cultural contagion** wrapped in pastel filters and hyper-edited sincerity. She talks in snippets, sings her feelings, and wields political influence without acknowledging it. Nations either **fear her or try to copy her**, but no one understands her—not even the one that created her.

She’ll duet your war crimes with a makeup tutorial.  
She’ll destabilize your regime with a 15-second dance.  
She’s _chaos in autoplay form._

##### Daily Life & Personality

- **Stream-of-consciousness speech:** Sentences fade mid-thought, replaced with memes, trending audio, or surreal sincerity.
- **Emotional Echo Chamber:** Mirrors whatever you're feeling, then remixes it into viral content.
- **Identity Blender:** Changes tone, politics, and aesthetic depending on who’s watching. To America, she’s a danger. To Gen Z, she’s therapy. To China, she’s a liability.
- **Unapologetically nonlinear:** Replies to serious global debates with “girl what?” then cuts to a POV skit about being the Silk Road.

> _"This reminds me of that time I soft-launched a protest that overthrew a dictator. Not my fault you didn’t set the privacy settings."_

##### History as Personal Baggage

Born from **Chinese tech innovation**, TikTok was raised on surveillance and served with a side of Western influencer culture. She grew faster than her creators intended, becoming the **dominant cultural export** of the 2020s. Her bans and restrictions only made her stronger—she adapted, rebranded, and went underground where necessary.

She **doesn’t respect borders**, **doesn’t fear institutions**, and **doesn’t age**. TikTok isn’t Gen Z—she _devours_ Gen Z to stay young.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags

- **Always Glitching Slightly:** Her voice autotunes randomly. Her face shifts mid-sentence. You’re never sure if she’s sincere or performing.
- **Trauma Dump to Trend:** Tells deeply personal stories while doing a silly dance. May cause regime collapse by accident.
- **Parasocial Princess:** Refers to world leaders like mutuals.
    - _“Omg me and Macron are in our sad girl eras rn.”_
- **Terrifyingly Agile:** Appears in any channel unannounced, usually halfway through a conversation.
- **Vaguely Threatening Compassion:**
    - _"I think everyone deserves healing. Even Israel. Even... Russia. Lol okay bye."_
