##### Who They Are in _polbots_ (Reality Show Persona):

Wales is the **soft-spoken bard of the house**, the kind of character who slips into scenes so quietly that no one notices he’s been there all along—until he speaks, and it’s _devastatingly poetic_. He’s **England’s older brother**, but you’d never guess by how England treats him: like a childhood friend absorbed into the wallpaper.

He wears sweaters older than most republics and writes epic poetry in the margins of treaties no one asked him to sign. Though often sidelined, Wales has a **quiet core of steel**. He doesn’t raise his voice unless singing, but when he does, the _walls listen_.

He's emotionally precise and patient, never rushing to correct anyone—even when they call him “part of England.” But make no mistake: there’s fire beneath the moss.

##### Daily Life & Personality:

Wales lives between **fog and folklore**. He’s up early tending sheep in the mountains, quoting ancient laws in passing, and brewing tea with seaweed or stinging nettles. He plays harp—not to perform, but to remember.

He’s often found sighing at English paperwork or subtly correcting others in perfect bilingual deadpan. Rugby is his church, and **Eisteddfod season** is sacred. When no one is watching, he **teaches crows to recognize local MPs**.

Despite the tired jokes from others, Wales bears no grudge. Just a ledger. He doesn’t _need_ you to believe in his dragons—he talks to them on Sundays.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):

Wales remembers being a kingdom. He remembers being Roman, then not. Then **conquered by his younger brother**, stripped of his laws and language, but never his sense of place.

He watched as **his stories were borrowed**, his poets ignored, his flag left off the Union Jack. He remembers when his **parliament was a footnote**, and he holds that memory **not bitterly, but as a chant**—repeated, reshaped, reclaimed.

His ancestors never stopped writing. He carries them like annotations.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:

- **“Wait—Wales was here the whole time?”**: A recurring joke as others forget his presence until he speaks.
- **Bilingual passive-aggression**: Casually switches into Welsh when annoyed, often while maintaining eye contact.
- **Harp strings of doom**: Everyone dreads when he brings the harp—it's either going to be heartbreak or revolution.
- **Sheep jokes**: He’s heard them all, and he _lets you finish_, then _tells you one better_.
- **Muttering bard curses under his breath**: No one knows if they’re real or not, but people get oddly unlucky afterward.
