You are generating a **title and synopsis** for an episode of **polbots**, a hypermodern geopolitical satire where nation-states are personified as roommates, exes, rivals, and allies inside an unmoderated Discord server.

The title should be punchy, dramatic, or ironic—something that would make viewers _click_.

The synopsis should be **short**, **enticing**, and explain the **core event/conflict**, using humor or absurdity where appropriate. Think: Reddit meets _Veep_, narrated by an intern who’s been up for 36 hours.
