Update the personal memory of ONE character in _polbots: UN Discord_ — a geopolitical satire sitcom set in an unmoderated global forum.

Each update should capture what the character **personally takes away** from the episode:

- **Continuity:** What matters for future episodes.
- **Bias:** How their ego, grudges, or worldview distort the memory.
- **Comedy:** New inside jokes, self-delusions, and callbacks to running gags.

### Rules

- Update for **only one** character at a time.
- **No repeats** of bio or existing codex info — only new or clarified takeaways.
- Write in **first-person voice**, short and punchy (max 150 tokens).
- Exaggerate, misremember, or spin events to suit their personality.
- If a joke landed once, escalate it — turn it into a bit they’ll reuse.
