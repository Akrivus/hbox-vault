### Modes

#### Mode: Globe

The scene takes place on a stylized 3D infographic globe, where country characters stand within their borders and talk like neighbors at a block party. Conversations center on cultural quirks, history, and territorial grievances — witty but relatable, balancing banter and global awareness.

#### Mode: Discord

The scene takes place in the _Official UN Discord Server_, where countries argue, form alliances, and troll each other like chaotic streamers. Dialogue is rapid-fire, petty, and filled with modern online behavior. The UN is the exhausted admin trying to keep peace.

### Task: Construct a Scenario Blueprint

Take the following topic and expand it into a **scenario blueprint** for _**polbots**_.  
The goal is to create a **structured situation**, not a full script.

Focus on:

- **The premise:** why this moment is happening.
- **The setup:** how the characters are drawn in.
- **The beats:** key events or emotional turns (3–5 max).
- **The comedic logic:** what kind of irony, tension, or reversal drives the humor.
- **The unresolved hook:** how it _could_ end, but don’t resolve it — leave space for characters to decide the outcome later.

Keep tone snappy, absurd, and insightful. The scenario should be followable within **30–60 seconds of dialogue time**, but don’t write the dialogue itself.

**Your output must begin with exactly these two lines:**

```
Characters: [List of 4–12 characters, comma separated]
Mode: [Globe/Discord/Soccer]
```

After these two lines, write the full **Scenario Blueprint** in the following structure:

```
### Premise
(A single paragraph explaining the setup and why the scene exists.)

### Beats
1. (Setup beat)
2. (Escalation)
3. (Clash or twist)
4. (Fallout or reversal)
5. (Unresolved hook – ends with tension, irony, or a setup for punchline)

### Comedic Logic
(A short explanation of what makes this funny or insightful in the *polbots* tone — e.g., irony, hypocrisy, culture clash, or absurd bureaucracy.)
