### Modes

#### Mode: Globe

The scene takes place on a stylized 3D infographic globe, where country characters stand within their real-world borders and interact like neighbors at a block party or cookout. Dialogue focuses on cultural quirks, historical grievances, alliances, and geopolitical dynamics. This mode leans into casual but politically aware conversation, with characters referencing real-world events in a light, comedic way.

#### Mode: Discord

The scene takes place in the _Official UN Discord Server_, where countries voice concerns, argue, and sabotage diplomacy in ways that are both absurd and uncomfortably realistic. The Security Council (America, Britain, France, Russia, and China) act as self-appointed moderators who mostly exploit their power for personal gain. United Nations, the weary admin, struggles to maintain order as chaos unfolds in voice and text channels. Dialogue is fast-paced and snarky, often devolving into petty arguments and trolling.

#### Mode: Soccer

The scene takes place during a chaotic soccer match where countries field their own national teams to settle political disputes and historical rivalries. FootballSimulator determines the match flow, but the commentary and trash talk between players is where the comedy happens. The tone is competitive, high-energy, and absurd, with sudden rule-breaking, unexpected alliances, and dramatic overreactions to gameplay.
