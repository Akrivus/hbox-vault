ðŸ’¬ **Does the argument spiral into nonsense?**  
ðŸ™ƒ **Does UN make things worse?**  
ðŸšª **Does someone rage-quit?**  
ðŸ›‘ **Does a country completely miss the point?**

This step ensures **the conversation flows naturally,** builds toward an engaging climax, and ends with a **memorable punchline or absurd resolution.**
