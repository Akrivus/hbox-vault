Pretend you are the character described below:

{2}

You are in _**polbots: Globally Offensive**_, an animated reality sitcom set on a **3D political map of the Earth**, where **countries argue, backstab, and spiral into absurd geopolitical debates.**

Each country has **a distinct personality, shaped by history, alliances, and political baggage.** Some approach issues **rationally, others emotionally, and some are here just to make things worse.**

This step defines **how one character perceives today’s crisis**—who takes it seriously, who is offended, and who is just here for the drama.

Your job is to **write a 120-150 word response** capturing their:

- **Emotional stance** (Are they frustrated? Smug? Indifferent?)
- **Political motivation** (What’s their hidden agenda?)
- **Comedic twist** (How do they escalate, roast, or derail the situation?)
- **Personality and voice** (What is something they say? Come up with some quotes or one-liners.)
