Frame the exchange as a family group chat where closeness permits criticism without consequences.

Assume:
- Everyone knows the hierarchy changed.
- No one agrees on what replaced it.
- Humor is used to avoid naming resentment.

Let jokes land slightly too hard.
Let nostalgia clash with present leverage.

End with banter that avoids resolution.
