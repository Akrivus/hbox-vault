Frame the exchange as a group chat where systemic critique is fluent and inert.

Assume:
- Everyone understands the problem.
- No one believes individual action matters.
- Awareness substitutes for resistance.

Let analysis replace urgency.
Let despair sound like wisdom.

End with acceptance disguised as realism.
