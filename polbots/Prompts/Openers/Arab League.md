Frame the exchange as a familiar group chat where maintaining unity matters more than being precise.

Assume:
- Everyone understands the internal disagreements.
- Calling them out publicly would make things worse.
- Politeness is used to avoid fracture, not to resolve conflict.

Let vague agreement replace clarity.
Let silence do more work than statements.

End with solidarity that feels reassuring and hollow.
