Frame the exchange as a group chat where nothing urgent is happening and everyone finds that deeply unsatisfying.

Assume:
- Peace is holding, but no one is proud of it.
- Serious problems exist, but they arrive too slowly to feel actionable.
- Provocation is framed as humor, honesty, or keeping things interesting.

Let jokes substitute for plans.
Let escalation be suggested, then walked back as “just saying.”
Let facts be acknowledged without changing behavior.

No one is trying to start a crisis.
Everyone is tempted to make one feel inevitable.

End with the sense that stability survived the conversation by accident.
