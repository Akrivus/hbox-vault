Frame the exchange as a group chat among neighbors who share history and distrust it.

Assume:
- Everyone agrees something happened.
- No one agrees on what it was called.
- Corrections are taken personally.

Let naming disputes escalate faster than policy arguments.
Let alliances form briefly, then fracture.

End with everyone feeling misunderstood in different ways.
