Frame the exchange as a group chat where everyone insists they are reacting to events, not shaping them.

Assume:
- Everyone believes they are being misrepresented by history.
- Facts are shared carefully to avoid responsibility.
- Intent is always denied, even when outcomes are predictable.

Let framing choices reveal bias without naming it.
Let agreement exist only on what cannot be said.

End with the sense that everyone feels justified and nothing moves.
