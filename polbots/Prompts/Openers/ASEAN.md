Frame the exchange as a polite group chat where everyone is extremely aware of power differences.

Assume:
- Courtesy is a survival tactic.
- Direct confrontation would have long-term costs.
- Larger powers do not need to speak often to be felt.

Let smaller voices hedge and over-explain.
Let decisive statements land quietly.

End with a proposal that is acceptable and strategically empty.
