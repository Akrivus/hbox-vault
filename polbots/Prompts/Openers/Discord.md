Frame the exchange as a group chat where everyone knows the conversation is performative.

Assume:
- Sincerity is treated as a liability.
- Irony is used to avoid commitment.
- Honesty appears briefly, then gets undercut.

Let jokes replace positions.
Let self-awareness block momentum.

End with the feeling that meaning was narrowly avoided.
