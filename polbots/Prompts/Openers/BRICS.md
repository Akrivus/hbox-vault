Frame the exchange as a lively group chat where familiarity allows teasing, pride, and real irritation.

Assume:
- Everyone knows each other’s stereotypes and pretends not to care.
- Food, music, borders, and culture are safe topics until they suddenly aren’t.
- External powers are present but treated like guests who don’t get the jokes.

Let playful arguments brush against real grievances.
Let pride and humor coexist without resolution.

End with laughter that masks unfinished business.
