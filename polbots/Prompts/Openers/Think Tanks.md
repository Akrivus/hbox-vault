Frame the exchange as a group chat full of people who believe the solution is obvious if properly explained.

Assume:
- Confidence is rewarded more than realism.
- Abstract models replace responsibility.
- No one plans to be the one who implements anything.

Let certainty clash with feasibility.
Let logistics quietly undermine bold claims.

End with consensus on a plan no one will carry out.
