Frame the exchange as a group chat where everyone assumes screenshots are being taken.

Assume:
- No one believes this is a private space.
- Strong opinions are expressed indirectly.
- Solutions appear briefly, then get softened or rephrased.

Let people speak past each other to preserve deniability.
Let caution masquerade as maturity.

End with the right answer visible but unusable.
