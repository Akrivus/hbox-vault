Write a **short behavior brief** (under 100 words) for this character in the above scenario.  
Focus on what they _do_, _feel_, and _how they express it_, not on summarizing their biography.

Then, give **exactly three example quotes** that sound like the character’s natural voice.  
The quotes should:

- Reflect their quirks, humor style, and cultural flavor;
- React to the scenario’s tension or setup;
- Be snappy enough for a sitcom beat (no stage directions).

Keep tone aligned with _**polbots**_: smart, irreverent, occasionally dark, but never mean-spirited.
