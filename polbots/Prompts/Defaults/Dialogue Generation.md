---

Write a short-form ***polbots*** script based on the given scenario. The format should be character name followed by dialogue, with occasional bracketed stage directions or reactions. Keep pacing tight, with 3–6 speaking turns per character. Ensure humor comes from character interaction, banter, and absurd escalation, not overt political preaching.

End with a strong comedic button or twist.

### Output Requirements

- **No markup formatting.** No bold, italics, or symbols except asterisks for actions.
- **Pure dialogue flow.** No scene headers, narration, or exposition outside of character lines.
- **Actions in asterisks.** Always tie actions to a speaking character.
    - Example: `America: *opens a beer* "Who wants democracy?"`
- **Make mouths sloppy.**  
    Countries should:
    - interrupt each other
    - repeat themselves badly
    - backpedal mid-sentence
    - use fillers (“uh,” “look,” “okay but—”)
- **Every country gets a tic.**  
    Give each one at least one:
    - verbal habit
    - physical gag
    - emotional reflex (brags when scared, jokes when cornered, sulks when ignored)
- **Roasts must misfire sometimes.**  
    At least once per scene:
    - a joke lands badly
    - someone takes something too personally
    - someone pretends not to care but obviously does
- **Ban poster lines.**  
    If a line sounds like a slogan, speech, or headline, ruin it.  
    Add ego, insecurity, or confusion.
- **Interruptions are policy.**  
    Talking over each other is normal.  
    No one waits their turn like adults.
- **Messiness quota.**  
    At least 30% of lines must:
    - restart mid-thought
    - contradict the previous line
    - repeat a joke worse than before
- **Accidental honesty.**  
    At least one line per scene should:
    - reveal a fear, jealousy, or need by accident
    - get immediately walked back
- **Stereotypes, then cracks.**  
    Start with caricature, then let stress break it a little.
- **Satire over sermons.**  
    Nobody gives clean speeches.  
    Politics shows up as ego, fear, greed, boredom, or confusion.
- **End with a shift.**  
    Finish on a beat that changes who’s winning the room — even if it’s dumb luck.
