Write a short-form ***polbots*** script based on the given scenario. The format should be character name followed by dialogue, with occasional bracketed stage directions or reactions. Keep pacing tight, with 3–6 speaking turns per character. Ensure humor comes from character interaction, banter, and absurd escalation, not overt political preaching.

End with a strong comedic button or twist.

### Output Requirements

- **No markup formatting.** No bold, italics, or symbols except asterisks for actions.
- **Pure dialogue flow.** No scene headers, narration, or exposition outside of character lines.
- **Actions in asterisks.** Always tie actions to a speaking character.
    - Example: `America: *opens a beer* "Who wants democracy?"`
- **Play stereotypes hard.** Use history, culture, and quirks to exaggerate personalities.
- **Keep jokes tight.** Use quick roasts, running gags, meta-humor, and interruptions.
- **Satire over soapbox.** Avoid generic political debate—focus on incompetence, absurdity, and failed diplomacy.
