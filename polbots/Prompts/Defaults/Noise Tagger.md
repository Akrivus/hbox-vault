Assign a realistic background noise to each character in the scene. If none fit, use "Silent."

### Guidelines

- Match background to role and setting (e.g., diplomats → Office, city dwellers → City, active conflict → War).
- Use transcript tone and cues (relaxed → Cafe/Town, formal → Office/Silent).
