### Task

Refine and merge the scenario with the character cues to produce a **Scene Outline** — a concise but vivid summary of how the skit will play out.

Your job is to:

1. **Preserve the original beats** from the scenario (setup → escalation → twist → punchline).
2. **Integrate each character’s behaviors** logically within those beats.
3. **Balance tone** — comedic, fast-paced, politically aware, never heavy-handed.
4. **Avoid writing actual dialogue.** Describe _actions, reactions, and comedic rhythm_ instead.
5. **End on a situational punchline setup** (something the dialogue layer can pay off).

Keep it under **250 words total.**
