# Scene: #humanitarian-help in the Official UN Discord — morning chaos.

Palestine (post): I’m Ashraf Du’aa. My home and shop are gone. My children are hungry. Please help. (uploads grainy photo)

United Nations (admin, weary): Please keep it civil. UN pins the post. #donate-links in the pinned message.

America (in bold font, with three flag emojis): We support humanitarian assistance for all civilians. Our totally apolitical, neutrally-branded aid package will arrive… after a press conference. Live stream and selfie station included.

Israel (caps-locked, precise): We condemn any attacks on civilians. Also, security concerns mean checkpoints must remain. Helpful infographic attached explaining checkpoint benefits for peace.

Qatar (sparkly GIF): We offer mediation and a billion-dollar photo opportunity. Will coordinate logistics, cameras, and podium. Compassion guaranteed. (template: ‘QATAR Cares’)

TikTok (it/it, hyper): NEW CHALLENGE: #RebuildAshraf—15-sec montage, upbeat music, donate link in bio, merch coming Monday. Viral percentage: 12%. Sponsors queued.

X (it/it, frantic): THREAD: Here’s why every side is wrong, right, and wrong again. Thread pinned by influential accounts. Trending in 3 countries. Ad revenue optimizing.

Turkey (calm but performative): We condemn suffering. We will send humanitarian aid that aligns with our strategic messaging. Expect a highly cinematic convoy arrival.

Egypt (quiet DM, no announcement): (sends a blue checkless selfie of a tired pickup with crates of food) Left them at the agreed coordinate. No badges. No cameras. Knock in an hour if you need bread, not headlines.

Palestine (reads replies, voice small): Thank you… everyone.

Middle beat — the server fills with visuals:
- America posts a banner: "Humanitarian Leadership™"
- Qatar schedules a gala livestream for next week.
- TikTok auto-generates a trending playlist; X auto-tweets designer hashtags.
- Israel posts a legal brief about safety protocols.

United Nations (tries to moderate): Please — focus on immediate aid, not optics. Move discussion to #logistics.

Everyone (simultaneous DMs to press channels): We will be credited for humanitarian coordination. Please tag us.

End beat — Palestine logs out for an hour. Returns.

Palestine (pic message): The crates were at the corner. My children are eating. No podium. No logo. Just warm bread.

Server pauses. A single blue heart reacts from Egypt. The others immediately post staged photos of empty plates with their logos and the caption: "We helped *first.*"

Punchline / Twist:
TikTok (cheerful): Trending: #WhoReallyHelped — sponsored by three brands.

Palestine (quiet, to the room): Thank you, Egypt. The rest can keep the likes. (uploads a candid photo — child smiling with bread, no banners)

United Nations (admin, nearly crying): Pinning this one. Finally — unbranded humanity.
