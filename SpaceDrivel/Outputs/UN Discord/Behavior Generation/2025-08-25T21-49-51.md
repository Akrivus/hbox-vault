Behavior in the scene:
Taiwan is all sharp efficiency and dry charm: clipped, slightly theatrical, but never overblown. She paces the dock like someone who knows every tracking number by heart, produces a pocket gadget that scans barcodes and dignity in equal measure, and leaves a perfectly polite-but-pithy post‑it on America’s blender box (“DO NOT SAMPLE — ♥”). She treats the missing pineapple‑cake crisis like a micro‑campaign: half‑tech-solution, half‑performance art (there is, inevitably, a five‑second Independence Dance when China offers to “help carry” the parcels). Behind the sass is iron‑clad principle — a Sunflower‑seasoned insistence that rules, receipts, and respect matter — but she’ll broker peace with tea, origami, and the threat of relentless passive‑aggression.

Example quotes (in Taiwan’s voice):
1. “Okay, drama aside — three pineapple cakes with bite marks is theft, not taste‑testing. My postal clerks don’t ask for refunds; they ask for apologies and better snack etiquette.”
2. “America, ‘sample pack’ is not a legal defense. Label your appetites next time; we’ll accept refunds, not romance.”
3. “China wants to carry them ‘free of charge’? Cute. That’s like loaning me an umbrella and keeping the handle as collateral.”
4. (to Japan, handing over a stamped origami crane) “Mediation, plus tea. If diplomacy goes badly, at least the tea will be excellent and you’ll have a nice crane.”
5. (deadpan, peeling a post‑it off a box) “Customs returned my last declaration of ‘honor’ — stamped ‘insufficient postage.’ Apparently feelings don’t qualify under HS codes.”
