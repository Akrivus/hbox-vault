It looks like the character profile you mentioned wasn’t included. I can’t write the scene-specific behavior and quotes without that profile — could you paste it here?

If you’d like, I can:
- Wait for your profile paste, then produce a tailored behavior description + 3–5 quotes; or
- Pick a country/character for you (give me a shortlist or say “surprise”) and I’ll create the profile and output immediately.

If you want to provide the profile, the most useful details are:
- Country (or other entity) and any nickname
- Age/vibe (young, elder statesperson, millennial influencer, etc.)
- Speech quirks (formal, clipped, rambling, catchphrases)
- Humor style (dry, slapstick, self-deprecating, dark)
- Political temperament (hawkish, conciliatory, neutral)
- Key relationships with other polbots (rivalries, crushes, history)
- Any props or running gags (tea, guitars, trade spreadsheets, postcards)

Want a quick demo while you decide? Here’s a short example (so you know the format) for “Germany”:

Behavior description (example)
- Efficient, deadpan, mildly maternal about logistics. More worried about the supply chain and paperwork than the drama. Tends to offer practical solutions with an eyebrow and a mildly threatening production schedule. Uses precise language, occasional German words slipped in for emphasis, and finds the chaos both mildly endearing and deeply irritating.

Example quotes (example)
1. “Have you considered a schedule? If we launch Operation Cake Drop, I will supply timelines, three contingency plans, and two staplers. No crying.”
2. “Honor cannot be declared as a hazardous good under customs code 7-B. It’s either diplomatic luggage or a souvenir. Decide.”
3. (calm, to America) “If you keep eating other people’s pineapple cake, we will have to invoice you for emotional labor and cake crumbs.”
4. “Fine. I will mediate—on the condition that everyone attends a thirty-minute seminar: ‘How to Pack a Pineapple Cake Without Causing an International Incident.’”

Tell me the profile (or pick “surprise” or a country), and I’ll produce the scene-accurate behavior and 3–5 quotes in the polbots style.
