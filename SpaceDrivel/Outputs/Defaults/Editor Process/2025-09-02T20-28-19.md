All Hands Meeting — Mess Hall

A ring of scarred metal tables glints under buzzing fluorescent strips. Beyond the condensation-misted windows, the Anomaly pulses a slow red, like a heartbeat you can hear through the hull. The room smells faintly of coffee substitutes and damp metal. A laminated binder sits on the table in Sara’s quivering shadow; a microphone handle gleams where Odin’s fingers hover; a sealed duffel rests where Dana’s chair would normally be. The atmosphere feels like duct tape stretched between crisis and routine.

Sara stands at the head, binder clutched in both hands as if it were a shield. The crew gathers—Odin, Gabe, Dana, Tony, Mina—each with a piece of the ship’s mood tucked into their pockets.

Sara: Let’s log the facts, not the fear. The ship runs on data, not dreams. We’re here to study the Anomaly, not pretend it’s a bedtime story.

Odin steps toward the mic, a ceremonial tremor in his voice. A thin grin that’s almost a wince crosses his face as he plants his feet and tilts his head, as if listening to something only he can hear.

Odin: The Befröst yawns open, and we are not charting a course so much as walking a bridge that forgot how to close behind us. Words were always bridges, but bridges pretend to carry us and then tally our failures; Heimdall coughs in the vents and we call it wisdom.

Gabe leans back—jaw tense, eyes bright with the ache of a memory unspoken. He does not interrupt so much as hover at the edge of a question and wait to see if someone else will risk it first.

Gabe: Define hurt. This one asks for a measurement, notes in Echoes of Self: hurt is a patient who will not lie down even when the bed is made. This one does not sleep. The line “This one does not sleep” becomes a prescription for watching the room breathe.

Dana’s chair squeaks as they shift, drawing focus back to a more practical calculus. They cradle the duffel as if it could outrun the conversation, eyes half-hidden behind a fringe of hair, hands steady but not perfectly so.

Dana: Subprotocol four, says the manual we pretend is a cookbook. Break the crisis into steps, over-explain each one until calm sounds like a weapon, and the tremor stays just out of sight. The log-stick is not a transmission error; the ship’s memory is trying to talk to us in a language we forgot how to translate.

Tony: Maybe it’s not ideal, but every messy variable teaches us where the gaps live. If we log Odin’s stanza as data for once, we might salvage a truth from these corrupted minutes. Does that make sense?

Mina’s eyes shift between the binder, the log-stick, and the duffel. Her mouth flattens into a line that isn’t a smile but is almost a dare. She steps into the center of the ring, tipping her chin toward Sara but not breaking eye contact with the others.

Mina: Sara, step back for a breath. The room is a tribunal, but you don’t need to become the verdict. Words collapse under the ship’s heartbeat, but we can still choose the rhythm we answer with. If we don’t take the sample, we die trying to be careful. That’s a choice too, and it has a cost.

Sara’s mouth tightens; she fully intends to talk, but she stops before the first syllable leaves her lips. She glances at the binder like it’s a captive animal she could set free if she’s careful enough. Her breath stutters, then steadies.

Sara: The binder is for appearances, not for truth. I won’t pretend minutes are progress when they’re not. The ship has an opinion, and mine is to pretend I don’t hear it until it breaks us all.

Odin’s smile returns, a tremor that might be relief or fear.

Odin: Then we’ll hear it together. The Befröst is a patient thing, friends. It will wait even as it test-drives us into the next choice.

Gabe’s gaze shifts to the log-stick, the device that’s supposed to capture a record of them all, yet seems to be rewriting itself every few seconds. His voice is careful, almost clinical, but the tremor hints at something deeper—the ache of being required to hold a narrative that doesn’t fit the ship anymore.

Gabe: The baseline. If we don’t establish a credible baseline for memory versus minutes, we’ll keep patching the hull with words and call it engineering.

Dana leans forward, the duffel resting weightlessly between her knees, a silent counterpoint to the rest of the room’s drama. Her tone is practical, deliberate, as if she were laying out a maintenance procedure to keep a life-support line from failing.

Dana: Subprotocol four again, then. We break this into steps. Step one: acknowledge the echo of a lie in the minutes. Step two: identify the source of the distortion. Step three: act in a way that reduces risk to the crew. Step four: reassess. Step five: patch what we can patch, and study what we can’t.

The room tightens, as if someone has drawn a thread through their chests and pulled it taut. The overhead speakers cough—twice, then once more—with a brittle metallic sound that makes the group flinch. The words that follow feel less like a transmission and more like an accusation.

Speaker (overhead): You will bring it home.

Silence swells, thick and expectant. The minutes on the wall—their own altered contents—shift and slide, rewriting themselves in a script that feels like a joke you’d rather not finish. The line about progress gleams faintly in the new text: progress replaced with sacrifice.

Sara’s eyes narrow. She slips her hand into her binder, rips out a page she already knows is damaged beyond use, and mutters something under her breath that blends resignation with resolve. She tears it, folds it in half, and sets it aside with the stubborn precision of someone who has learned to organize their fear into a file.

Sara: This is not a failure of memory. It’s a failure of trust—and we’ve all added a little salt to that wound. But I’m going to log what we know, and I’m going to log what we don’t, and I’m going to patch the hull if it kills me.

A tremor passes through the room, the kind that makes a door or a wall or a memory seem suddenly negotiable. The corridor beyond the mess hall shivers—the image of a door folding into a child’s room for a heartbeat flickers in some shared sensor-memory and dies almost as soon as it’s noticed. The crew looks up, instinctively, as if listening for a far-off breath.

Mina’s gaze slides to the corridor and back to Dana’s duffel, then to Gabe, who has been watching the pulse of the ship as if it were a patient he can diagnose by touch. Mina steps closer to the table, her voice dropping to a level that carries authority without shouting.

Mina: If we don’t take the sample, we die trying to be careful. But if we do take the sample, we might still die. The question is what do we owe the ship? What do we owe Befröst? We can’t pretend risk isn’t the currency here. We can’t pretend progress isn’t a lie if the hull is still breathing this red.

Tony nods as if he’s been waiting for that. He eyes the log-stick now, the device that seems to mock them with its own tiny rebellion, and clamps down on a plan.

Tony: We run a tiny, controlled sample. We log the readings, we treat it as a hypothesis rather than a dare, and we monitor the hull’s response. If we see the heartbeat speed up, we stop. If we see a sign of stabilization, we proceed with caution. We keep the minutes honest this time.

Dana’s mouth tightens into something like a smile that isn’t a smile at all—the upturned corners of a mask that doesn’t fit neatly anymore. They take a breath, then speak with a quiet steadiness that has the ring of subprotocols actually working for once.

Dana: Under subprotocol four, we begin with a stepwise approach: we acknowledge the distortion, we isolate it, we pursue a controlled observation of Befröst’s behavior in a limited sample. Then we reassess. Then we patch. The duffel is not cleaning supplies. It never was. It’s an emergency containment kit for a memory of a memory, a last line of defense against letting fear run the show.

A beat passes. The room settles into a careful rhythm, as if all the words have found a temporary place to stand. The log-stick seems to glow faintly, as though the act of naming the problem has given it some oxygen.

Odin speaks again, softer now, almost like a patient explaining a difficult ritual to a child.

Odin: We must remember that bridges are only as strong as what they carry, and what they carry is not merely the present. The memory of what was sacrificed can form a plinth for what we choose to do next. If we can phrase our fear as a direction rather than a sentence, the corridor won’t fold into a child’s room again.

Gabe watches Sara a moment longer, then slides a hand to the edge of the table, touching the laminated binder as if to ground himself in a shared, unspoken agreement. His voice remains calm, but the tremor in his hands betrays the strain of carrying a truth too heavy to bear alone.

Gabe: Define the baseline we’re aiming for, and what we do when we find it. The body remembers what the minutes forget. We’ll tend to the body with kindness, even when the minutes lie.

Mina glances toward Sara again, then toward the duffel, then back to the room. The tension in her shoulders eases just a notch as she feels the room hinge toward a decision rather than a verdict.

Mina: If we don’t take the sample, we risk the memory of who we are becoming. If we take it, we owe ourselves a plan that isn’t just about avoiding the obvious danger. We owe the ship a reason to trust us again. We owe Befröst a chance to show whether it’s a threat or a mirror.

Sara looks down at the floor, where the specks of light from the mess hall tiles glitter like a constellation of small choices. She takes a long breath and taps the binder with the back of her knuckles as if to remind herself that this is still a tool, not a weapon.

Sara: Then we patch the hull. We run the sample in a controlled way, we document the anomaly with as much honesty as the tape will hold, and we let the ship—let Befröst—have a say in what we do next. But we do it with a plan that isn’t dependent on faith alone, and we keep the minutes straight this time.

The overhead cough fractures into a sigh and then a soft, stubborn click—the sound of a door somewhere in the ship yawning open and admitting possibility rather than fear. The corridor beyond the mess hall holds steady for a heartbeat, then the red pulse of the Anomaly seems to soften just enough to listen.

The room settles into a tense, careful quiet. The “you will bring it home” line lingers, a warning and a promise all at once. The minutes on the wall begin to reflect not a story of sacrifice, but a plan: a path that treats sacrifice not as a fall, but as a coordinate.

Mina steps in again, quiet but clear, and her voice carries the weight of a decision that has finally moved from argument to action.

Mina: Then we take the sample, we measure what we can, we log what we know, and we patch what we can patch. If we die, we die with coordinates. If we live, we live with a plan that belongs to all of us, not a single voice, not a single fear.

Dana nods, the duffel resting between their knees as if it belongs there now, the symbol of a truth they refused to hide any longer. Tony’s shoulders loosen just a fraction, as if he’s been holding a map that’s finally useful.

Tony: Then we execute the small, controlled run. We monitor the hull, we document the readings, and we keep the minutes honest. If the ship has an opinion, we’ll answer with data.

Odin lifts the mic again, but the tremor in his voice has softened into something closer to resolve than ritual.

Odin: If Befröst is a bridge we cross, let us cross it with our eyes open and our hearts honest. And may the ductwork hear us not as a chorus of fear but as a chorus of, perhaps, care.

The group sits with a new, tense calm. The log-stick’s display flickers once, then steadies, as if acknowledging the shift from fear to strategy. The corrupt minutes rewrite themselves once more, but this time toward a chorus of shared intent rather than a single, accusing line.

The final beat lands not with a thunderclap but with a measured breath: the plan is set, the risk is defined, and the crew—fugitives, failed clones, washed-up war heroes, and interns who never left—has traded a patchwork sermon for a patched hull.

The door between memory and action slides shut on a heartbeat that doesn’t break the ship. The Anomaly hums once, a question asked and answered not by words alone, but by the work that follows: log the facts, take the sample, patch what you can, and bring it home—together, with a plan that can survive the ship’s own opinion.
