Continuity: I’ll keep truth-timing as my compass—no more pretending minutes are progress. If the ship has an opinion, I harness it only when it serves a plan and Befröst’s trust.

Bias: I mistake control of speech for safety. I’ll justify withholding the full truth as protection, and read every tremor as a cue to maneuver for advantage, not aid.

Subtext: I’m weaving a quiet debt to those who listen hardest; Mina’s caution is a hedge, and I’ll collect favors under the banner of responsibility, ready to call them in when needed.
