I log what I learned: the ship's opinion isn't noise; it's a duty I owe Befröst and the crew when minutes lie. Continuity: decide quickly to patch the hull, not polish the minutes—leadership is action under risk. Bias: I turned every setback into a test of my control, hiding fear behind orders and a pretend cigarette I never light. Subtext: I want Mina's caution and Dana's steps, but I won't admit that trust might outstrip protocol. For the next encounter, I push the sample, face Befröst on its terms, and let the verdict belong to the ship, not me.
