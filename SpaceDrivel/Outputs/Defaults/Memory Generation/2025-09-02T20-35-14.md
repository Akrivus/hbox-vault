Continuity: I will treat the ship’s opinion as data, not doctrine. In the next crisis, I log truth plainly and push for a plan that translates Befröst’s tremor into concrete steps, not ceremonial cure-alls.

Bias: I lean toward control; I’ll mistake calm for certainty and call that rational. Loyalty becomes a ledger I balance against risk, always privileging what preserves order over what unsettles it.

Subtext: I fear being undone by honesty, so I cling to composure and cadence. The quiet vow I won’t speak aloud: I’ll steer when the minutes beg me to pretend nothing happened, and hope the hull forgives the cost.
