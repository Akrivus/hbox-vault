Memory update: I remember the binder as a shield, not the truth. Continuity: I’ll keep carving a crisis path with “Just in case,” turning every breath into a calculable step so the ship’s tremor reads as progress. Bias: I treat risk as guardrails for the mission, not warnings about my own limits. Subtext: I hear the ship’s opinion and pretend I don’t, because acknowledging it would feel like admitting I failed. When the breaking comes, I’ll own the collapse as the moment I finally decided—against the noise—to decide.
