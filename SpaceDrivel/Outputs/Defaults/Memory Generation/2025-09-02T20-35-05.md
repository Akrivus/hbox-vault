Mina: I take away that survival hinges on legitimacy, not bravado. The sample isn’t a verdict; it’s a contract with Befröst: measure, log, plan, then pilot. Continuity: push a transparent protocol—clear roles, no blame, a shared survival plan. Bias: I distrust Sara’s theatrics and Odin’s myth-talk; I’ll shield the crew from ritual and turn debt to trust by showing results. Subtext: I am the quiet fulcrum, moving pieces under restraint to keep us alive. If sacrifice’s asked, I demand a real plan, not a rite.
