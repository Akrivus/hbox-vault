Continuity: Befröst becomes a partner in my logs; future decisions hinge on a real plan that includes her voice, not my instinct. I’ll enforce a living baseline—measure, patch, recheck—so minutes become momentum.  
Bias: I quiet the ship to keep control, convincing myself I’m protecting us, when really I’m guarding my own authority and fear of being overridden.  
Subtext: I crave indispensability and calm, even as I’m always listening for the next fracture in trust. If someone else shows up with a better patch, I’ll call it a mistake—not a shift in who runs this ship.
