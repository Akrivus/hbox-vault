- Doctor. Surgeon. Not a therapist.
- Baseline as memory-vs-minutes metric and shared breath with the hull; without credible baseline, patching is just words.
- Hurt as a measurable, non-silent condition; seeks objective data to ground care.
- Diagnosis and identity are the same process; clinical framework governs self-understanding.
- Observational, clinical phrasing; notes skin tightens, voice lifts rather than naming feelings.
- Self treated as separate agent; Echoes of Self journal persists; "This one does not sleep" as a recurring cue.
