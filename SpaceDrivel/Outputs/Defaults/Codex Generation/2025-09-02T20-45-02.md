- Mina frames risk as solvable through concrete steps: sample, measure, log, patch; log what we know; patch what we can.  
- Mina ties taking the sample to trust and a survival plan: if we take it, we owe Befröst a reason to trust us and a plan to survive whatever it chooses.  
- Mina asserts collective ownership of the outcome: if we live, the plan belongs to all of us.  
- Mina endorses Befröst piloting as the mechanism to move forward.  
- Mina maintains sharp, pointed communication to drive action and test who’s listening.
