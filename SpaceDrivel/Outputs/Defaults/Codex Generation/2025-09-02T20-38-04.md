- Befröst yawns open; crossing a bridge that forgot to close behind us.
- Mythic framing persists; a prophetic presence heard in the environment.
- Befröst is patient but will not wait forever.
- Crossing may be salvation or the last gift we earned for Befröst.
- Language as bridges; words carry us and reveal our failures.
- Crossing requires honesty; eyes open, hearts honest.
