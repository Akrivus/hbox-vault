- Doctor. Surgeon. Not a therapist; clinical, disassociated, eerily calm; maintains the view that diagnosis and identity are the same process.
- Hurt is a measurable datum; “Define hurt” used to quantify pain; logged in Echoes of Self.
- Baseline must be credible for memory versus minutes; patching the hull with words is not engineering.
- Baseline described as a shared breath with the hull.
- Observations, not feelings; language remains clinical and translational.
- Echoes of Self remains central; self-diagnosis and identity treated as a single process.
- The rupture/pulse metaphor: hull’s pulse flickers red; rupture is the body remembering too much; tended with careful clinical tenderness.
- Risk is a symptom; intervention requires informed consent; courage is a byproduct of watching the clock.
- The duffel as medical symbol: not cleaning supplies; a saline bag for memory of trust; a temporary cure for the ache of holding the ship together with trembling hands.
- The “This one does not sleep” motif persists: journal pages flutter; the self watches the room breathe.
