- Data-first: log facts over fear; ship runs on data, not dreams
- Binder is for appearances; minutes must reflect truth, not progress
- The ship has an opinion; she will pretend not to hear it until it breaks us, then listen together
- Plans to face Befröst with honesty; patience wears thin
- Baseline concept: baseline is a shared breath with the hull
- Leadership through micromanagement and emotional repression; mask maintained to prevent cracking
- Commands with "I need you to…" and uses conditional phrasing to mask intent; cuts self off mid-sentence when emotion rises
