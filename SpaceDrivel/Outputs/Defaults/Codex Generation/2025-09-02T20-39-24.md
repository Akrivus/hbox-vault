- Befröst framed as a crossing bridge, not a charted course.
- Corrects "Bifrost" to "Befröst" and treats the anomaly as sentient (she/they).
- Hears Heimdall in the ductwork; reads environmental cues as prophecy and panic.
- Frames crossing Befröst as salvation or the last gift earned for Befröst; aims for cosmic safety.
- Befröst is patient, but patience wears thin; it will not wait forever.
- Maintains mythic framing and ceremonial speech style despite crisis.
