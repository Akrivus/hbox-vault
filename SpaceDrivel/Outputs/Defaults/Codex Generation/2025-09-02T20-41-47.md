```
- Subprotocol four governs Dana's crisis method: break crisis into steps and over-explain to keep calm.
- Dana foregrounds truth-detection: acknowledges the echo of a lie in the minutes to root out distortion.
- Dana's process: identify distortion, act to reduce risk, reassess, patch what you can patch, study what you can't.
- Baseline priority: seeks credible baseline for memory vs minutes to avoid patching hull with words.
- Default justification habit: "Just in case" as a standing precaution.
- Jargon shield: uses official subprotocol four framing to lend authority and calm.
