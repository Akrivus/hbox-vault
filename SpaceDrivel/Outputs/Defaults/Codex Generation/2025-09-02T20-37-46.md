- Speaks in mythic metaphors: Befröst yawns open; crossing a bridge that forgot how to close behind us, a cosmic call
- Befröst is patient, but it will not wait forever
- Hears Heimdall in the ductwork; prophecy and panic in the same breath
- Crossing Befröst may be salvation—or the last gift we earned; cross with eyes open and hearts honest
- Corrects Bifrost to Befröst every time
