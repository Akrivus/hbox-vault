- Subprotocol four drives Dana: crisis broken into steps (acknowledge distortion; identify source; reduce risk; reassess; patch; study).
- Acknowledges distortion in minutes and actively seeks its source.
- Baseline view: memory vs minutes anchored by a shared breath with the hull.
- Patch-first mindset: fix what you can; study what you can't.
- Calming through explanation; tremor stays out of sight.
- Jargon shield: relies on "According to subprotocol fourâ€¦" to justify actions.
- Enduring pattern: hyper-prepared, serious, anxious; default "Just in case" rationale; seeks fallback.
