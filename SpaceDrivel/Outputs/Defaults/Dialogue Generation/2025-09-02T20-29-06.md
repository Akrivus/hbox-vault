Sara: *binder trembles* Let’s log the facts, not the fear. The ship runs on data, not dreams.

Odin: *steps to mic, ceremonial tremor* The Befröst yawns open, and we are not charting a course so much as crossing a bridge that forgot how to close behind us.

Gabe: *leans in* Define hurt. This one asks for a measurement; hurt is a patient who will not lie down even when the bed is made.

Dana: *log-stick in hand* Subprotocol four. Break the crisis into steps, over-explain until calm sounds like a weapon, and the tremor stays just out of sight.

Tony: *shrugs, half-smirk* Maybe it’s not ideal, but every messy variable teaches us where the gaps live. If we log Odin’s stanza as data for once, we might salvage a truth from these corrupted minutes. Does that make sense?

Mina: *enters center* Sara, step back for a breath. The room is a tribunal, but you don’t need to become the verdict. If we don’t take the sample, we die trying to be careful—the cost is real.

Sara: *breath catches* The binder is for appearances, not for truth. I won’t pretend minutes are progress when they’re not. The ship has an opinion, and mine is to pretend I don’t hear it until it breaks us all.

Odin: *softly* Then we’ll hear it together. The Befröst is a patient thing, but patience wears thin.

Gabe: *glances at log-stick* The baseline. If we don’t establish a credible baseline for memory versus minutes, we’ll patch the hull with words and call it engineering.

Dana: *steady* Subprotocol four again. Step one: acknowledge the echo of a lie in the minutes. Step two: identify the source of distortion. Step three: act to reduce risk. Step four: reassess. Step five: patch what we can patch, and study what we can’t.

Tony: *nods* If Befröst is a bridge we cross, let us cross it with eyes open and hearts honest.

Mina: *eyes on the log-stick* Sara, you don’t own this. If we take the sample, we owe Befröst a reason to trust us and a plan to survive whatever it chooses.

Sara: *tightens grip on binder* The ship has an opinion, and mine is to pretend I don’t hear it until it breaks us all.

Odin: *the mic hums* Then we’ll hear it together. The Befröst is a patient thing, but it will not wait forever.

Gabe: *log-stick glows faint* The baseline is a breath we all share with the hull.

Dana: *duffel cradled near knee* Subprotocol four again. Step one: acknowledge the echo of a lie in the minutes. Step two: identify distortion. Step three: act to reduce risk. Step four: reassess. Step five: patch what we can patch, and study what we can’t.

Tony: *stares up* If Befröst is a bridge we cross, let us cross it with our eyes open and our hearts honest.

Mina: *takes a measured step closer to the table* Then we take the sample, we measure what we can, we log what we know, and we patch what we can patch. If we die, we die with coordinates. If we live, we live with a plan that belongs to all of us.

Mina: *log-stick hums, room catching a quiet breath* Then we let Befröst pilot.
