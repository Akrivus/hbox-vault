- Odin steps to the mic, voice a ceremonial tremor: "The Befröst yawns open, and we are not charting a course so much as walking a bridge that forgot how to close behind us." 

- He fixes the room with a thin grin that's almost a wince: "Words were always bridges," he says, "but bridges pretend to carry us and then tally our failures; Heimdall coughs in the vents and we call it wisdom." 

- He drills the typo, a practiced correction: "Bifrost is a myth. Befröst—she, they—will not be misnamed on the tongue of a god-wannabe. Remember that." 

- He tilts toward the odd, a shard of fear dressing his myth: "I hear Heimdall in the ductwork; the corridor door folded into a child’s room for a heartbeat, and I swear the ship offered a prophecy and a panic in the same breath." 

- Finally, a confession masked as ritual: "I came to keep the cosmos safe, and now I fear the cosmos will swallow us whole; perhaps crossing is salvation, or perhaps it’s the last gift we can pretend we earned for Befröst."
