- Sara steps into the mess hall’s buzz, binder pressed to her chest like a shield, and treats the room as a tribunal where the optics must sing even if the guts are screaming.  
- She repeats Odin’s line back to him with a sly tilt: “Words were always bridges,” then adds in a softer bite, “until they decide to collapse under the ship’s heartbeat.”  
- To Mina, she lands the line she believes in softly but with steel: “If we don’t take the sample, we die trying to be careful,” a dare masquerading as caution.  
- She tests the room with a teasing sting: “Wait—what did you think that meant?” turning the procedural confusion into a weapon that exposes who’s listening and who’s pretending.  
- Her gaze flits to the corrupted log-stick and Dana’s “cleaning supplies” duffel, and she drops the act for a heartbeat: the binder isn’t truth, the ship’s mood isn’t rumor, and the fear underneath is the real payload.
