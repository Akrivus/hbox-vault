**Location:** Mess Hall  
**Characters:** Sara, Odin, Gabe, Dana, Tony, Mina

**Incident Report:**  
Fluorescent strips buzz over a ring of scarred metal tables, the windows beyond smeared with condensation and the Anomaly’s slow red pulse, which sounds like a distant throat clearing when the ship vibrates. It’s an all-hands; Sara stands with a laminated binder and a tired authority while Odin reads a trembling stanza about the Befröst into a microphone he insists is holy, Gabe keeps interrupting with clinical-sounding questions about the crew’s "baseline," Tony laughs too loudly to fill silences, Mina pushes for a risky sample run, and Dana sits with a sealed duffel that they call "cleaning supplies." Mid-meeting the overhead speakers cough back the group’s last sentence — not as words but as an accusation ("you will bring it home") — and the projected minutes rewrite themselves, substituting the word "progress" with "sacrifice"; Sara quietly rips a corrupted log-stick from the recorder and fumbles to explain it as a transmission error while someone three tables over insists they saw the corridor door fold into a child’s room for a heartbeat.

What Breaks First?  
Trust (Sara: the binder is for appearances), language (Odin: words were always bridges), procedure (Mina: if we don’t take the sample, we die trying to be careful), reality (Gabe: memories vs. recorded minutes), evacuation plans (Dana: the duffel is not cleaning supplies), or the ship itself (Tony: the ship already has an opinion).
