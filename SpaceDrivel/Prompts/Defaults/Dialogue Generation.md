_A special instruction or one-liner that sets the tone. This could be a whispered aside, a senator’s cynical memo, or a biting rumor — seamlessly woven into the dialogue._

---

Write a short-form *Space Drivel* script based on the given scenario. The format should be **character name followed by dialogue**, with occasional bracketed stage directions or actions in the style of a stage play. Keep pacing tight, with 3–6 speaking turns per character.

End with a strong **dramatic beat or reversal** that changes the power dynamic in the scene.

### Output Requirements

- **No markup formatting.** No bold, italics, or symbols except asterisks for actions.
- **Dialogue only.** No external narration — everything is spoken or performed.
- **Actions in asterisks.** Use physicality to suggest psychological states or sensory disruption.
    - Example: `Ervik: *taps helmet glass like it's a terrarium* "It hissed again. That's three today."`
- **Play archetypes off-kilter.** Lean into roles (scientist, officer, fugitive, zealot), but fracture them under stress.
- **Let tone swing.** Serious, surreal, or darkly comic — all are valid if grounded in character emotion.
