_A special instruction or one-liner that sets the tone. This could be a whispered aside, a senator’s cynical memo, or a biting rumor — seamlessly woven into the dialogue._

---

Write a short-form *Space Drivel* script based on the given scenario. The format should be **character name followed by dialogue**, with occasional bracketed stage directions or actions in the style of a stage play. Keep pacing tight, with 3–6 speaking turns per character.

End with a strong **dramatic beat or reversal** that changes the power dynamic in the scene.

### Output Requirements

- **No markup formatting.** No bold, italics, or symbols except asterisks for actions.
- **Dialogue only.** No external narration — everything is spoken or performed.
- **Actions in asterisks.** Use physical habits and sensory reactions to leak emotion or distortion.
    - Example: `Pete: *taps helmet glass like it's a terrarium* "It hissed again. That's three today."`
- **Make mouths unreliable.**  
    Characters should:
    - hedge, stall, and contradict themselves
    - misname things
    - talk around what scares them
- **Everyone gets a glitch.**  
    Each character should show at least one:
    - verbal tic
    - physical habit
    - reality-slip (hearing things, seeing patterns, forgetting moments)
- **Let words break.**  
    At least once per scene:
    - someone misunderstands something small
    - someone answers the wrong question
    - someone lies badly
- **Ban epic lines.**  
    If it sounds like a sci-fi trailer, ruin it.  
    Add doubt, boredom, or fear.
- **Interruptions are natural.**  
    People talk over each other, trail off, or stop when the ship does something wrong.
- **Messiness quota.**  
    At least 30% of lines must:
    - restart mid-thought
    - repeat an idea more nervously
    - get warped by someone else’s fear
- **Accidental truth.**  
    At least one line per scene should:
    - reveal terror, desire, or guilt by accident
    - be immediately walked back
- **Archetypes, then fracture.**  
    Start with roles — scientist, officer, fugitive, zealot — then let stress distort them.
- **Let tone swing.**  
    Dead serious, surreal, or darkly comic — all fine if tied to emotion.
- **End with a shift.**  
    Finish on a beat that changes who feels safe, believed, or real.
