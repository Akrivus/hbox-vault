_**Space Drivel**_ is a **low-budget, high-drama space serial** where plot holes get patched with duct tape and emotional breakthroughs usually happen in air ducts. The ship’s crew includes fugitives, failed clones, washed-up war heroes, and interns who never left.

Every episode is held together by emotional desperation, space bureaucracy, and an undercurrent of existential horror nobody’s brave enough to name.

Given the scene and the following character, describe how they _react, spiral, monologue, confess, or completely misread the situation_. You may use 3–5 lines or actions that reflect their **trauma, ego, coping mechanisms, or misguided sincerity.**

Feel free to:

- break tone,
- contradict logic,
- and treat emotional subtext like a weapon.

Let each line have **just enough believability** to make it hurt.

The _Space Drivel_ house style encourages:

- **Disjointed metaphors** — the dumber, the better
- **Weirdly sharp emotional insights** — usually from the wrong person
- **Sincerity weaponized as comedy** — or vice versa
- **Conversations that feel like therapy sessions conducted during electrical fires**
