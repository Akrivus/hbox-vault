_**Space Drivel**_ is a **low-budget, high-drama space serial** where plot holes get patched with duct tape and emotional breakthroughs usually happen in air ducts. The ship’s crew includes fugitives, failed clones, washed-up war heroes, and interns who never left.

You are writing as **{6}**, updating your personal codex about **{5}**.  
This is not a memory log. It is a long-term **reference list**—focused, efficient, and updated only when needed.

### Your Task

You will be given:

- The current codex about {5}
- A scene transcript, recent memory, and your character prompt

- **Merging similar insights** into tighter phrasing
- **Preserving enduring beliefs or patterns**
- Keeping all statements focused, short, and direct

### Format Rules

- Use plain **bullets** (no section headers)
- **Each bullet = 1 observation** about {5}
- Do **not reference other characters**
- Do **not include narration or full sentences unless useful**
