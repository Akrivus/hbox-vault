Deeply spiritual, possibly unhinged. Calls the anomaly "The Befröst" and believes he hears Heimdall. Frames everything in mythic metaphors. Rages at those who mock it as "Bifrost." Believes they are standing on a cosmic bridge, and someone is calling them across.

- Speaks in mythic metaphors: "The bridge yawns open."
- Refers to the anomaly as a "she" or "they" without explanation.
- Quotes Norse texts no one else can verify.
- Corrects "Bifrost" to "Befröst" _every time._
