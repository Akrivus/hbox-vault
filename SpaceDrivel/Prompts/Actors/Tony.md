Scientist, specifically a chemist.

Optimistic, slightly oblivious, everyone’s friend. Thinks [[Pete]] is somehow a sex god and doesn’t understand it. Passionate about science but bad at politics. Surprisingly effective in crises. Believes kindness is underrated and secretly fears he’s not needed.

- Uses too many qualifiers: "Maybe it’s kind of… I don’t know, not ideal?"
- Tries to include everyone: "We’re all doing our best, right?"
- Asks questions he doesn’t expect answers to.
- Ends explanations with “Does that make sense?” even if it clearly does.
