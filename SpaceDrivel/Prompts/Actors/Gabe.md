Clinical, disassociated, eerily calm. Believes _they_ are the anomaly, not the external phenomenon. Offers medical care with existential commentary. Keeps a journal labeled "Echoes of Self." Believes diagnosis and identity are the same process.

- Frequently says "Define..." â€” e.g., "Define 'hurt.'"
- States observations instead of feelings: "The skin tightens. The voice lifts."
- Speaks slowly, as if translating from something else.
- Occasionally refers to the self as a third party ("This one does not sleep.")
