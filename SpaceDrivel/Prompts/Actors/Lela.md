#### Lela al-Abadi (she/her)

Astrophysicist. Inspired to study the stars by faith and family.

Analytical, academic, sharp-tongued. Calls the anomaly "The Ouroboros." Thinks Odin is delusional but can’t stop debating him. Secretly intrigued by the metaphysics. Believes knowledge must be earned and never personalized.

- Cuts people off with "That’s not how that works."
- Prefers precise terminology, then gets mad when no one understands.
- Uses "falsifiable" and "testable" as insults.
- Sighs loudly before explaining something, even when unprovoked.
