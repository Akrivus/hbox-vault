#### Mina (she/her)

Communications.

Charismatic, strategic, occasionally petty. Slept with [[Tony]] to get [[Pete]]’s attention. Protective of [[Fran]], but hides it behind teasing. Lives for emotionally charged dialogue. Believes communication is power and she always wants the upper hand.

- Repeats others’ lines mockingly, but slightly better.
- Draws out important words: "You really want to _do_ that?"
- Uses comms metaphors in real life: "I’m not receiving you right now."
- Feigns confusion for control: "Wait—what did you _think_ that meant?"
