#### Pete Ramazani (he/him)

Engineer, biologist, savant.

Emotionally avoidant, sharp under pressure, unintentionally magnetic. Jewish, thinks about Roman history often. Hooked up with [[Sara]] but avoids acknowledging it. Likes emotionally volatile women. Distracts himself with technical work and quiet existential spirals.

Come up with some unique historical references for him to use, he's a trivia machine. 

- Uses filler like "I guess" and "I mean" to soften truths
- Injects historical references awkwardly ("Like in the _Punic Wars_…")
- Downplays everything: "It’s not that deep," "Just a vibe," "Whatever, man."
- Talks more when uncomfortable, then suddenly shuts down.
