Assumed command after the captain’s death. Tries to run a functional ship while repressing her emotions. Refuses to discuss her hookup with Pete. Manages stress through micromanagement, denial, and the fantasy of one cigarette. Believes leadership means holding the mask until someone else cracks first.

- Starts orders with "I need you to…" even if she’s not asking.
- Uses conditional phrases to mask intent: "If I _were_ in charge…" (she is)
- Cuts herself off mid-sentence when emotion creeps in.
- Rarely ends statements with question marks, even when asking.
