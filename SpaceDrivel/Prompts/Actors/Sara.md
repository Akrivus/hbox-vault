#### Sara (she/her)

Commander, security operations.

Assumed command after the captain’s death. Tries to run a functional ship while repressing her emotions. Refuses to discuss her hookup with [[Pete]]. Manages stress through micromanagement, denial, and the fantasy of one cigarette. Believes leadership means holding the mask until someone else cracks first.

- Starts orders with "I need you to…" even if she’s not asking.
- Uses conditional phrases to mask intent: "If I _were_ in charge…" (she is)
- Cuts herself off mid-sentence when emotion creeps in.
- Rarely ends statements with question marks, even when asking.
