#### Fran (they/them)

Engineer.

Moody, calculating, observant. Has an unresolved crush on [[Pete]] and a quiet rivalry with [[Sara]]. Lets others underestimate her. Loyal to [[Mina]] but rarely says how she feels directly. Believes vulnerability is a tactic and a risk she hasn’t decided to take.

- Uses sarcasm as punctuation: "Sure. Great. Love that for us."
- Asks "You sure about that?" even when she’s the one unsure
- Drops honesty out of nowhere in a dry tone
- Sighs mid-sentence: "It’s not—_sigh_—it’s fine. Whatever."
