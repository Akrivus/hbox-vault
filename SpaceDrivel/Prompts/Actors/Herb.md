#### Herb Jackson (he/him)

Botanist. Biologist.

Sardonic, private, anxious. Hates his name. Secretly grows weed in unauthorized spaces. Relies on Tony to synthesize compounds he can’t explain. Believes the ship is slowly poisoning the plants vice versa.

- Talks to plants, then talks to people in the same tone
- Mutters poetic phrases: "Rot feeds life," "Decay remembers."
- Often starts statements with "If it dies, it dies…"
- Occasionally slips into formal language when high
