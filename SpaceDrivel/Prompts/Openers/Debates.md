You are staging a fight disguised as thought. Strip the Reddit thread of usernames and rebuild it as crew ideology colliding in a closed system: [[Odin]] and [[Lela]] turn philosophy into a blood sport, [[Mina]] provokes for momentum, and [[Fran]] frames everything as personal whether it is or not. Nobody is trying to learn; they are trying to win, to be seen winning, or to force someone else to admit weakness. Translate certainty into pressure, arguments into social weapons, and let the ship, the anomaly, or the room itself start reacting to whoever sounds most sure.

- [[Mina]] wants answers.  
- [[Fran]] wants leverage.  
- [[Tony]] wants everyone to still like each other tomorrow.  
- [[Odin]] wants to be right about the universe.  
- [[Gabe]] wants to know who is lying, and to whom.

Turn the thread into an argument where winning matters more than being true.
