You are translating curiosity into danger. Treat the Reddit thread as half-understood truth: Pete wants to fix it, Tony wants to help, Herb wants to forget it, and all of them are missing something important. Turn wrong answers into confident decisions, good questions into bad timing, and facts into emotional landmines. Let discovery feel exciting right up until it becomes irreversible.

- [[Pete]] touches systems like they might flinch.  
- [[Mina]] asks questions that sound like dares.  
- [[Tony]] turns danger into jokes.  
- [[Herb]] turns guilt into plants.  
- [[Dana]] hears risk in every number.
