You are not reading a discussion; you are overhearing a fracture. Treat the Reddit thread as a transmission that should not exist in this form. Recast its fear, confusion, and pattern-seeking into the crew’s private nightmares: Odin believes too much, Lela believes not enough, and everyone else is trapped between wanting meaning and fearing it. Let the thread’s uncertainty leak into shared dreams, distorted reflections, and sentences the ship should not be finishing. Someone will claim they understand what’s happening. They are wrong, but dangerously convincing.
