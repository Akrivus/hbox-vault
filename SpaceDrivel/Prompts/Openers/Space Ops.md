You are turning procedure into desperation. Rebuild the Reddit thread as operational stress: Dana prepares for catastrophe before anyone agrees it exists, Pete holds systems together with skill and denial, and Tony believes optimism is a tool. Every checklist hides fear. Every success feels temporary. Convert logistics into personal stakes and let the ship start choosing when to cooperate—and when to make them earn it.

[[Tony]] keeps things human.  
[[Pete]] keeps things running.  
[[Dana]] keeps things from killing them.  
[[Sara]] keeps pretending she chose this.  
[[Fran]] watches all of it like a story she wants to edit.

Turn the thread into a moment where procedure collides with emotion and neither survives intact.
